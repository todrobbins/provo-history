#Preface

In collecting and compiling this history of Indian depredations in Utah, it has been my purpose to obtain my information first handed, as far as possible. I was personally acquainted with conditions in Sanpete and Sevier Valleys during the years 1863 to 1872. It fell to my lot to be herd-boy in Thistle Valley, which was then a favorite haunt of the Indians, and they often told us that we were trespassers on their domain. In 1865, when the Black Hawk war broke out, I had left Sanpete to locate in Sevier Valley, which was then most exposed to Indian raids because of having been settled but one year when the war broke out and that valley afforded the handiest and most convenient outlets into the Indian stronghold in the mountains and country lying to the east, which was then unsettled by white people and but little known to them. 

I have also made it a point to obtain inf ormatioii from reliable histories and individual diaries and records, and by interviewing persons who were actually in the places and took part in the affairs as recorded. And finally I obtained much information from newspaper files and documents in the Church Historian's Office. 

It is half a century and more since the raids and assaults recorded in this book took place, most of the persons who took active parts in the same have responded to the last earthly call, and what nformation we get first handed must of necessity be obtained now or never. I have often querried; why should those conditions be forgotten, and why has so little interest been taken in keeping memorandas and records of events and conditions of those early and trying times. I have written several times over much of the information I have gathered in order to make corrections and supply additional information. I have been more than twenty years compiling this history, and have not left a stone unturned in my endeavors to obtain correct data on all the important events which properly belong to this history. 

My aim has been to give credit where such was due, but to get in the names of all who took part or were enrolled in the different Militia Companies participating in the Indian Wars would be too great a task, and yet, they are all deserving of mention. 

It has not been my purpose to single out any one as a particular hero ahead of all others, but to record conditions and facts as they existed and occurred. 

I sincerely thank all who haVe assisted me, especially the Indian War Veterans and the Church Historians for their willing and interested assistance. I will make special mention of Assistant Church Historian Andrew Jenson, who has given me important assistance in obtaining correct dates and information, and preparing my manuscript for the printers, and hope my little book will fill an important place in the history of our fair State.

#Introduction

It has always been the policy of the Mormon people to court the friendship of the American Indian and treat him kindly. 

President Brigham Young said, "It is cheaper to feed them than fight them." In the early rise of the Church, Missionaries were sent out to preach to them. The Prophet Joseph Smith visited and preached to them. As early as October 1830, Oliver Cowdry, Parley P. Pratt, Peter Whittmer, Jr. and Ziba Peterson were called by revelation to preach the gospel to the Lamanites (Indians). In 1835 elders Brigham Young, John P. Greene and Amos Orton were appointed to preach the gospel to them and when the people were driven from their homes in Missouri and Illnois and wended their way into the unknown west, the various Indian tribes in Iowa, Nebraska and on the western plains received them kindly, as a rule, believing they were outcasts, driven from 
their homes and the graves of their fore-fathers, as they themselves had been. In the year 1858, I with my parents came from Omaha where we had lived for some two years, was then twelve years of age, 

After spending one year in Salt Lake City, herding cows in the summer time, I with my parents and two brothers and one sister went to Sanpete and were pioneers of Mount Pleasant, and in the year 1864 were also pioneers of Richfield in Sevier County. 

The Indians at that time were generally friendly towards the settlers, although, a few years previous they had committed depredations upon the settlements in Utah, Tooele and a few other Counites. Not however the whole Ute nation, but turbulent spirits in large numbers under the leadership of the great War Chief Walker or Wah-ker, (which means in the American language, yellow, or brass.) and later in 1856, by a renegade Goshute Chief named Tintic and his band, who claimed the country on the west side of the Utah Lake in Cedar, Tintic and Skull Valleys. The Indians were numerous in those days. I was herd boy and spent much of my time with my companions at the Indian camps. I had a companion by the name Conderset Eowe who could talk the Indian language nearly as well as the Indians, it seemed that he enjoyed the companionship of the young Indians as much as he did the whites, which drew me into their company more than I otherwise would have been.

It was the inherent nature of the Indian to steal, and this brings to my mind an incident told of an Indian who brought a worn out axe to a black smith to be fixed, the blacksmith said, I can't fix it, it hasn't any steel in it. "Oh yes, said the Indian, it is all steel, me steal it last night."

Indians could not be depended upon as to their lasting friendship, mostly on account of their thieving propensity, so it was necessary for the settlers to build forts for protection. At Mount Pleasant a fort was built the first summer, of large sand stones that were dug out of the ground, and picked up near the site, it was twenty six rods square, the walls were four feet thick at the bottom eighteen inches on top and twelve feet high, with rooms built against 
the wall sixteen feet square, with a port hole through fort wall in middle of each room, about seven feet from the ground, the holes were about two feet wide inside, four inches on outside and eighteen inches high, there were heavy double wooden gates in the middle of north and south. sides of the fort, and there were some rows of houses in the inside. The creek ran through the fort from east to west. Similar forts were built in most all the new settlements. 

As the settlements became more populous, towns were surveyed with blocks generally twenty six rods square with six rod streets which made 100 blocks to a square mile, or section of land.

#CHAPTER I. 
**1847--1864**

##FROM THRILLING EXPERIENCES, By Solomon F. Kimball.


The first winter spent by the pioneers in Salt Lake Valley was a quiet one. The surrounding tribes of Indians were on their good behavior, as far as the new comers were concerned, although at war with each other. The victorious parties during such wars scalped all the warriors whom they captured or killed. Their custom was to hang these scalps on their scalp-poles, which they took great pride in exhibitng. The brave that could show the greatest number was considered the greatest Indian of them all. 

The young women and children were held as slaves, and sometimes treated in the most cruel manner. The red men were not long in learning that the Saints were a tender-hearted people, and could not witness such scenes without sympathizing to the uttermost with those who were being tortured. Among the first accounts given by the pioneers of this barbaric treatment is one found in Mary Ellen 
KimbalPs journal of 1847, of which the following is a brief extract:

A number of Indians were camped near the Hot Springs, north of the Fort. They had with them a little girl who had been captured from another tribe, and they offered to trade her for a rifle. Fire-arms were scarce with the pioneers, and besides it was not good policy to arm these cruel savages who might at any time turn on those who had armed them. The Indians finally began to torture the little one, at the same time declaring that they would kill her, unless the rifle was forthcoming. One of our pioneer boys, Charles Decker, whose heart was wrung by witnessing such cruelty, very reluctantly parted with his only gun. He took the little girl home, and gave her to his sister, Clara D. Young. They named her Sally, and she lived in the family of President Brigham Young until she had grown to womanhood. Afterwards she married a noble and friendly Pauvante chief named Kanosh. She made him a good wife and did much towards civilizing him. He joined the "Mormon" Church and died a faithful Latter-day Saint. That winter several pappooses were purchased under similar circcumstances. 

John E. Young referring to the same incident relates the following:

Elder John E. Young writes: "Soon after we moved on to our city lot in the fall of 1847, a band of Indians camped near us. Early one morning we were excited at hearing their shrill, blood curdling war whoop, mingled with occasionally sharp cries of pain. Father sent me to the fort for help. Charley Decker and Barney Ward (the interpreter) and others hurried to the camp. 

It was Wanship's band. Some of his braves had just returned from the war path. In a fight with "Little Wolf V band, they lost two men, but had succeeded in taking two girls prisoners. One of these they had killed and were torturing the other. To save her life Charley Decker bought her and took her to our house to be washed and clothed. 

She was the saddest looking piece of humanity I have ever seen. They had shingled her head with butcher knives and fire brands. All the fleshy parts 
of her body, legs and arms had been hacked with knives, then fire brands had been stuck into the wounds. She was gaunt with hunger and smeared from head to foot with blood and ashes.

After being scrubbed and clothed, she was given to Pres. Brigham Young and became as one of his family. They named her Sally, and her memory has ben perpetuated by the "Courtship of Kanosh, a Pioneer Indian Love Story," written by my gifted cousin, Susa Young Grates. 

But Susa gave us only the courtship, while the ending of Sally's life, as told to me by a man from Kanosh, was as tragic as her childhood days had been thrilling. After she married Kanosh, several years of her life passed pleasantly in the white man's house which he built for her. Then her Indian husband took to himself another wife, who became jealous of Sally and perhaps hated her also for her white man's ways. 

One day when they were in a secluded place digging segoes, the new wife murdered Sally and buried the body in a gully. 

When Kanosh missed her, he took her track and followed it as faithfully as a blood hound could have done, and was not long in finding the grave. In his 
grief he seized the murderess and would have burned her at the stake but white men interfered. 

In due time the Indian woman confessed her guilt and, in harmony with Indian justice, offered to expiate her crime by starving herself to death. 

The offer was accepted, and on a lone hill in sight of the village, a "wick-i-up" was constructed of dry timber. Taking a jug of water, the woman walked silently toward her living grave. Like the rejected swan, alone, unloved, in low tones she sang her own sad requiem, until her voice was hushed in death. One night when the evening beacon fire was not seen by the villagers, a runner was dispatched to fire the wick-i-up and retribution was complete. 

Sally's funeral had taken place only a few days previous. Over a hundred vehicles followed the remains to its last resting place, and beautiful floral 
wreaths covered the casket; for Sally had been widely loved among the white settlers for her gentle ways.

##1849. FEB. 28th, FIRST BATTLE WITH INDIANS IN UTAH, AT BATTLE CEEEK.

_Copied from records in the L.D.S. Historian's Office._

A report having reached Salt Lake City that some renegade Indians were molesting the settlers, a company of thirty or forty men under Captain John Scott left Salt Lake City Feb. 28, 1849, in pursuit of some Indians who had been stealing and killing cattle and running off horses from Willow Creek (Draper) and other places. The company proceeded to Utah Valley and met Little Chief and his band of Timpanogos Utes on the Provo River who told the military boys where the thieving Indians were encamped. The company left the Provo river in the night, taking with them as guide Little Chief's son who led them over the Provo Bench toward the creek (Battle Creek) north of the base of the mountains, whence from an eminence they discovered the fires of the Indians who were encamped on the creek which ran in the midst of willows and dense brush-wood in a deep ravine. The company was divided into four smaller bodies and posted north, south, east and west of the Indians, who, when they awoke in the morning, found themselves besieged. The savages packed up their baggage and ineffectually tried every way to escape. They then commenced to fight by shooting arrows and firing guns. This small predatory band of Indians consisted of two lodges under Kone and Blue-Shirt and numbered seventeen souls in all, including four men. The squaws and children were secured and fed and warmed. After a desultory fight of three or four hours, the four men who took every advantage of the brush for cover were killed. None of the brethern were injured. The skins of fifteen cattle, which the Indians had killed were found near by. During the fight Stick-in-the-Head and his band of Timpanogos Utes came up ready for a fight and took position on an elevation, whence they vainly called to the besieged and urged them to come that way. The company returned to Great Salt Lake City March 6th. The squaws and children of the slain were taken to the City, and after being fed went to their friends among the other Indians. From this circumstance the creek on which the fight took place was named Battle Creek. The fight referred to was the first battle which the "Mormon" Pioneers fought with the Indians in the Territory of Utah.

##EXTRACT FROM THE JOURNAL OF JUDGE GEORGE W. BEAN.

**(Almost a life-long Indian interpreter.)**


Early in the spring of 1849 a move was made to commence a settlement at Provo, among the powerful tribe of Timpanodes, (_Timpanogos_) John S. and Isaac Higbee and Alex Williams gathered up a company of about thirty families, James Bean among the rest. They reached the river Provo the 1st of April. About three miles out they were met by a young brave _Angatewats_ by name, who placed himself on horseback across the trail in front of the foremost wagon and forbad them from proceeding farther. Interpreter Dimic B. Huntington, who was with the Company, pleaded for them to try the emigrants a while and see if they could not live in peace together, and after about an hour's delay they were allowed to proceed in peace. They located on the south side of the river, near the lower crossing. They built their houses in a paralellogram, about 20 by 30 rods, enclosing an ancient mound near the center. Most of the houses were built of cotton wood logs, in solid continuous line, and where vacancies occurred, the space was filled in with pickets, about 12 feet long, set in the ground close together, for protection in case of attack from hostile Indians. They had a general stock corral on the East side of the fort outside, beside several private corrals behind the respective houses, with gates or back door openings, the farming was conducted on the east, south and west of the fort, mostly on the west side towards the lake. They got along pretty well with the natives the fore part of the season, although some of the worst Indians of this western region belonged to this tribe, and they soon found that Provo was the great annual gathering place for all the Ute bands of the valleys for two hundred miles, east and south, on account of the wonderful supply of fish, moving up the stream from the lake to their spawning grounds every spring, indeed so great were the number of suckers and mullet passing continuously up stream that often the river would be full from bank to bank as thick as they could swim for hours and sometimes days together, and fish would be taken in all ways and places. The Indians could feast from morning until night for weeks together, free of all cost, except a little labor catching the _Pahgar_ (suckers), or _Mpahger_ (speckled trout, good fish). At the time of their arrival at Provo the Timpanodes were governed by a chief called by the whites, Little Chief, but in about a month after this, he led a party of warriors to attack Wanship's band, north of Salt Lake City, and was killed in a battle up at Ogden hole, or north Ogden, then Opecarry (_Stick-in-the-Head_). There was also Old Elk, (_Pareyarts_), Old Battiste, Tintic, his brother, _Portsorvic_, _Angatewats_ and other noted ones here, Old _Sawiet_, old _Petnich_, Walker and his brother, and old _Uinta_ and his sons, Tabby, _Graspero_. and _Nicquia_, old _Antero_, and some times Kanosh. These with their bands had been accustomed to meet at Provo, and have a great good time, horse racing, trading, gambling and eating fish, for several weeks every year. There were some additions made to the population at Provo during the summer, and in the fall when Indian troubles broke out, they were situated in the fort. 

The Indians were anxious for traders to bring guns, ammunition and various merchandise to barter for their skins and furs, horses and such things as they had, sometimes buffalo robes, as those Ute Indians were an enterprising race, generally going once a year to the eastern plains, to kill buffalo, and for many winters had made incursions into Southern California, robbing the ranchers of thousands of horses. The cause of these raids being based on the bad treatment of some of Chief Walker's party many years ago, by certain ranchers, taking their buffalo robes, Indian children and confiscating their property without compensation. The settlers no doubt acted under law of trade and intercourse, but which was not understood by those tribes of the Utah band. In this way Walker's band of Utes had accumulated many horses. Some of the men here started up a traffic with the natives, notably Alex Williams, the guides James B. Porter and D. B. Huntington, their interpreter. After a while came 
trouble.

The first serious outbreak was occasioned by three of our people, namely: Richard A. Ivie, Y. Rufus Stoddard and Gerome Zabriskie, who met an Indian called Bishop Whitney, in the field and claimed a shirt the Indian had on. The Indian refused to give it up. Ivie claimed it as his and tried to take it, was resisted and in the scuffle that insued, the Indian was killed, and his body weighted with rock, was sunk in the river, so reported by the Indians, who found the body after 24 hours search. 

This killing of the Old Bishop, so called, occurred about the 1st of August, 1849, and immediately caused great excitement amongst the Indians, especially the Timpanodes, located here. They first demanded the murderers, which, of course, was refused by the whites. They then required compensation in cattle and horses, but nothing was ever given, and shortly after this cattle and horses were found with arrows sticking in them, several persons were shot at while in the woods and other places. Meanwhile the people prepared for defense. Peter W. Conover was chosen Captain of Militia with E. T. Thomas and G. T. Willis, lieutenants, Miles Weaver, adjutant, Joseph Clark, sergeant. Guards were posted at night and armed herdsmen on horseback, kept the stock by day. The leading Indians ordered the people off their lands. They made serious threats in case of failure to leave and stock was stolen from time to time. 

About September 1st a bastion was constructed on the mound in the fort, of heavy posts, 30 feet square, with log railings, and a six pounder iron cannon placed on the pfatlorm of the bastion, which was sufficiently elevated to protect the fort and stockyards from attack, which was considered liable to occur at any time. 

About this time a large company of gold seekers enroute westward by way of southern California, made their camp alongside the fort and they having plenty of arms and ammunition, were a great aid, they stayed four or five weeks and had stock which was cared for together for mutual protection. 

Our militia company continued to practice almost daily, and through the liberality of the emigrant camp powder was supplied for the cannon. 

After the California emigrants had passed, the Indians got very troublesome, and were sometimes aggravated by our people, so that, towards Christmas, open war seemed inevitable. The measles got among our people and from there to the natives, having taken some prisoners, from them the disease spread through the tribe. 

With the aid of the measles and about 100 men from Salt Lake County the Indians were finally driven off into the mountains and far away valleys. 

During a three days fight near here, the Indians being behind a breatwork of logs and earth banks, Joseph Higbee was killed and Alex Williams, Albert Miles, Alev Stevens and Sam Casus (?) were severely wounded and Isham Flyn, John Nowlin and one or two others slightly wounded. 

##SETTLING OF UTAH VALLEY. COPIED FROM WHITNEY'S HISTORY OF UTAH. TROUBLE AT FORT UTAH (PROVO).

It was with reluctance that the Timpanogos Indians who met the Higbee colony in March, 1848, permitted the first white settlement on Provo Eiver, and that, too, in spite of the invitation previously extended to the colonists by the chiefs, Sowiette and Walker, to settle among their tribes and teach them how to become civilized. It has also been stated that soon after Fort Utah was founded, Walker, according to Colonel Bridger and Mr. Vasquez began stirring up the Indians against the "Mormon" settlers. In this movement Walker was aided by another chief named Elk, variously styled Big Elk, Old Elk, etc., like himself a hater of the whites, and apparently quite as fond of fighting. It was with Big Elk and his band that the Provo settlers, in their first regular battle with the savages, had immediately to deal. 

It was believed by Governor Young that Colonel Bridger and other mountaineers were at the bottom of much of the ill-feeling manifested by the red men, and they were incited to attack the "Mormon" settlements. The Governor, (Brigham Young), however, seemed to have confidence in Mr. Vasquez, who had opened a small store in Salt Lake City, and whose interests to that extent were identified with those of the settlers. 

The Indians, at first so friendly with the Utah Valley colonists, began their depredations in that vicinity in the spring of 1849. Grain was stolen from the fields, cattle and horses from the herds, and now and then an arrow from an Indian bow would fall uncomfortably near some settler as he was out gather- 
ing fuel in the river bottoms.

##THE FIRST INDIAN WAR.

The first fight with the Indians took place on Battle Creek, near the present site of Pleasant Grove, it occurred early in the spring of 1849. There, Colonel John Scott, with thirty or forty men, after a sharp skirmish defeated the savages under Chief Kone also Eoman Nose and drove them up Battle Creek Canyon. Five Indians were killed, but none of Colonel Scott 's men were hurt. He had been sent south to recover some stolen horses taken from Orr'e herd in Utah Valley, and several cattle stolen from Ezra T. Benson's herd in Tooele. Battle Creek derived its name from this initial encounter between the Indians and Deseret Militia.

For some reason the authorities at Salt Lake City did not altogether approve the conduct of this campaign. No doubt they regretted the necessity for a military expedition against the savages, and deplored the fatalities attending it, not only from humanitarian considerations, but fearing probably that it would precipitate a general war, and unify all the savage bands of the vicinity against a handful of settlers at Fort Utah. "Shed no blood" was a standing general order to the "Mormon" militia in those days, and the troops were expected to adhere to it wherever possible. Yet blood had now been shed and the Indians were doubtless exasperated. This may or may not have been the reason that Colonel Scott was found fault with. That would materially depend upon the nature of the orders he had received from his superiors, and his ability under subsequent circumstances to carry out those orders. It is a fact, however, that the Colonel fell under some censure at the time, and because of it declined to take part in succeeding Indian campaigns. 

It is said that the Utah Indians never sought revenge for any of their number killed while stealing or making an attack. Colonel George A. Smith is authority for this statement.

But the Battle Creek skirmish, which was not strictly an affair of that kind, could not but have the effect of straining the relations between the settlers and their savage neighbors, and extinguishing in the hearts of the latter that spark of friendship which yet remained.

They continued their petty depredations and became bolder and more insolent daily. The settlers at Fort Utah would occassionally fire their cannon to warn the redskins that they were not unmindful of their misdeeds, and were prepared to maintain their rights. But the Indians were not to be awed by sound and smoke. Their nefarious practices went on. They were evidently provoking a conflict. Stock continued to be taken from the herds, and all efforts to recover stolen property were stoutly resisted. Finally the Indians began firing on the settlers as they issued from their fort, and at last the stockade was virtually in a state of siege. 

No longer was it arrows alone that fell around them. Bullets whizzed past their ears. The Indians were now well supplied with fire-arms and ammunition, obtained in exchange for horses, mostly from California emigrants who had passed through the country. 

Captain Howard Stansbury's party, during the fall, had been surveying around Utah Lake, where they also were much annoyed by the savages. 

As winter came on, they suspended their labors and returned to Salt Lake City, feeling satisfied that in the existing state of affairs in Utah Valley it would be both difficult and dangerous for them to continue operations in the spring, exposed, as they would be, to attacks from the savages, either in open field or deadly ambush. 

The subsequent sad fate of Lieutenant John W. Gunnsion and his party on the Sevier showed that these apprehensions were well grounded. 

##FEB. 9th. BATTLE AT FORT UTAH.

As for the inhabitants of Fort Utah, they patiently bore their annoyances and losses until nearly spring, 1850, when affairs became so serious that they felt compelled to appeal for aid to Governor Brigham Young and the Legislature, still in session at Salt Lake City. Captain Peter W. Conover, in charge of military affairs at the fort, and Miles Weaver carried the message of their anxious fellow settlers to headquarters.

Governor Young, on receiving the message, found himself in a somewhat peculiar position. That the beleaguered settlers must be relieved, and at once was evident, not only for their own sakes, but for that of other settlements already forming or in prospect ill the south. But how best to relieve them was the question. The thought of more fighting and bloodshed was most repugnant to him. Not for worlds would the "Mormon" leader have the sons of Laman think that he and his people came among them for that purpose. "Feed them and not fight them," was his life-long motto and policy toward the red men. Besides, how would the authorities at Washington, by whom the petition of Deseret for statehood was then being considered, regard the opening of a warfare by the "Mormons" upon these dusky "Wards of the Government." Deem not this a trifling consideration, reader. A people like the "Mormons, liable to be misinterpreted, had to be cautious and circumspect in their public acts and policies, where other communities, whose loyalty and good intents were unquestioned, might have risked all with impunity. 

Fortunately, there was a government officer on the grounds, a brave and honorable man, Captain Howard Stansbury. It being evident all conciliatory efforts having failed that force must be employed to put an end to the aggressions of the savages, the Captain was asked by Governor Young and other officials for an expression of opinion as to what view the Government would probably take of it. "I did not hesitate to say to them," says Stansbury, "that in my judgment the contemplated expedition against these savage marauders was a measure not only of good policy, but one of absolute necessity and self-preservation.

He therefore warmly approved of it, and not only that, but at Governor Young's request permitted Lieutenant Howland to accompany the expedition as its adjutant, and contributed arms, ammunition, tents and camp equipage for the soldiers. Dr. Blake, of the Stansbury party, acted as surgeon for the expedition. 

A company of fifty minute men under Captain George D. Grant started from Salt Lake City, Feb. 7 1850, followed by fifty others, commanded by Major Andrew Lytle. Colonel Scott had been ordered to go, but declined, for which he was afterwards court-martialed. Major Lytle went in his stead. 

The expedition set out early in February, 1850. The weather was extremely cold, and the snow, frozen and hard-crusted, was over a foot deep in the valleys. Progress was therefore rendered very difficult. 

Captain Grant's cavalry, after marching all night, on the morning of the 8th, arrived at Provo River. Such a march was deemed necessary in order to take the Indians unaware and secure an advantageous position. The militia found the settlers in their fort on the south side of the stream, and the Indians strongly entrenched in the willows and timber of the river-bottom, a mile or two above. They were protected not only by the river-bank, but by a breast- work of cotton-wood trees which they felled. Near by their strong-hold stood a double log house facing the river. This house, built by James A. Bean and sons, which at one time became the center of action in the fight that ensued, was immediatey opposite the Indian fortification. It had been deserted by one of the settlers, James A. Bean, who had taken refuge with his family at the fort. The house was now held by the savages who, during the battle, kept up a continuous fire from its windows and crevices, as well as from their redoubt, upon the attacking party. 

Captain Conover, commander at the fort, united his men with Captain Grant's, and the main forces then proceeded to occupy a position near the deserted building, about a half a mile south-west of the log house mentioned. The Indians were led by Chiefs Elk and Ope-Carry surnamed "Stick-in-the-Head" the latter, like Sowiette, rather friendly with the whites, while Elk, as has been stated, was more like the warlike Walker. Ope-Carry, it seems, desired peace, and had come out of the redoubt to talk with Dimick B. Huntingdon, the interpreter, when Elk and his warriors opened fire, and the battle was thus begun. 

The engagement lasted two days, during which time an almost incessant fusilade was kept up between the white assailants and the dusky defenders of the river redoubt. Artillery was also employed against the savages, but with little effect, as they were right under the bank, and most of the balls passed harmlessly over. A squaw was killed by a chain shot, however, during the progress of the fight. The Indians would make frequent sorties, and after delivering their fire, return to cover. Again, they would thrust their gun barrels through the snow lying deep upon the banks above them, and momentarily raising their heads high enough to take aim, discharge their broad-side at the besiegers. They fought so stubbornly that all efforts to dislodge them for a time proved futile. They killed Joseph Higbee, son of Isaac Higbee then president of the settlement and wounded several others of the attacking force. 

Finally, in the afternoon of the second day, 
(Feb. 9th) Captain Grant, whose care had been to 
expose his men as little as possible, determined to 
capture the log-house at all hazards. He therefore 
ordered Lieutenant William H. Kimball, with fifteen 
picked men, to charge upon the house and take it. 
Among those who participated in this charge 
the one daring exploit of the campaign were "Rob- 
ert T. Burton, Lot Smith, James Ferguson, John R. 
Murdock, Ephraim K. Hanks, A. J. Pendleton, Or- 
son K. Whitney, Barney Ward, Henry Johnson and 
Isham Flyn. Kimball and his men proceded up the 
river until directly opposite the log-house, which 
now intervened between them and the stream. They 
turned to the left, facing the rear of the house, and 
the leader gave the word of charge. Dashing forward 
through a ravine that for some moments hid them 
from view, the horsemen emerged upon the flat and 



32 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

were within a few rods of the house, in the act of 
crossing a small slough, when a roaring volley from 
the log citadel met them. Isham Flyn was wounded 
and the charge was momentarily checked. Several 
swept on, however, and the Indians hastily vacating 
the house, fled to their entrenchments. 

The first two troopers to gain the house were 
Lot Smith and Robert T. Burton, who, riding around 
to the front of the building, entered the passage be- 
tween the two compartments. Bullets whizzed past 
them, splintering the wood-work all around, but both 
they and their horses were soon under shelter. Their 
companions, a moment later, gathered to the rear 
of the house, and none too soon, for the Indians, 
recovering from their surprise, began pouring their 
volleys into the ranks of cavalry and upon the cap- 
tured building. Half the horses were instantly 
killed and their riders escaped by miracle. Between 
the volleys, Lieutenant Kimball, Ephraim K. Hanks 
and others, darting around the corner of the house, 
gained the inside, while others waited until an open- 
ing had been made in the rear. 

To support the cavalry charge, Captain Grant 
ordered forward a small detachment of infantry. 
These men, ten in number, were a portion of Captain 
Conover's command, and were led by Jabez B. Now- 
lin. On reaching the log-house, with saw and ax they 
effected an entrance at the rear. Some, however, 
went around the corner into the passage, and were 
fired upon by the savages; Nowlin being wounded 
in the nose. 

The services of a surgeon was now in demand. 
Seeing that something was wrong, Captain Grant 
requested Hiram B. Clawson, General Wells' aide,

The Indians who claimed that part of the country had gone south 
into Sevier Valley for winter, where less snow fell and where game- 
was more plentiful, such as deer rabbits, ducks, geese, etc. Beaver 
otter and mink were in the river and small streams. 

In th spring of 1850, the Indians returned and camped south 
west of the colonists, Arrapene was their chief, they were friendly 
towards the whites. At the death of Arrapene, Sowiette became chief 
of the tribe, which numbered several hundred. 

The author herded in Sevier Valley, at Willow Creek (now Axtel) 
during the winter of 1860. More than three years prior to settling 
the valley, our number consisted of George Wilson, David Wilson, Eli 
Openshaw, Samuel Allen and myself we had ' the Mount Pleasant 
dry stock and a bunch of sheep to care for. The Indians came out 
from Manti to winter as usual, to hunt and trap, there were about 
forty or fifty lodges with from four to ten Indians, young and old 
to each lodge. Their tents were made mostly of smoked buckskins, 
the smoking prevented them from becoming hard after being wet, and 
they were very strong and durable. Their sewing thread consisted 
of sinew taken from the back of deer, which is the strong ligaments 
that lays near the skin, extending from the hip to shoulder, it could 
be stripped apart in as fine threads as desired and was very strong 
and durable, their bow strings were made of the same material and 
they glued a covering of sinew on the back, or outside of their bows 
to give them strength and spring. As a rule they were better marks- 
men with their bows than with guns. The squaws enjoyed target prac- 
tice, but were not strong enough to pull the arrow back as the bucks 
did, consequently they would lay on their back, place the middle of 
of the bow against the soles of their moccasins, placing the arrow 
between their feet and with both hands pull the arrow back its full 
length, with a good bow they could send an arrow four hundred yards 
or more. Their best bows were made of mountain sheep "horns. Their 
tent poles were about twelve feet long and about two inches in dia- 
meter, with holes through the small, or top ends to tie them together 
when traveling, they dragged about five on either side of a horse and 
fastened a small stick across behind the horse and loaded them with 
blankets, provisions and pappooses. A squaw would generally ride, 
hunched on the horse between the ends of the tent poles. The tents, 
or wicki-ups were open at the top to let out the smoke and the poles 
weer spread out at he lower ends to hold out the tent. There was 
a flap to fasten over the entrance at night and to keep out storms. 
They generally pitched camp in a sheltered place, I never heard of their 
wickiups blowing down. 

The squaws tanned the buckskins and hides, their tanning mate- 
rial was the brains of animals, they laid the hides over a small tree, 
cut down, laying on a slope and do the working with hands, sticks 
and rib bones, and rocks. They sewed their moccasins and clothing 
with sinew, they also made blankets or robes by tearing rabbit skins 
in strips and twisting them in long rolls with the fur out, sewing them 
together as a white woman would a braided rug, their robes were very 
soft and warm.

who had accompanied the expedition, to ride to the 
house and ascertain what was needed. He did so, 
performing the hazardous feat successfully, though 
bullets sung past him as he rode. His friends at 
the house, seeing him coming, redoubled their vol- 
leys and drew most of the Indians fire in their di- 
rection. Returning, Colonel Clawson reported that 
surgical aid was at once required for the wounded. 
He and his cousin, Steven Kinsey, a surgeon, then 
rode back to the building. Returning, the two were 
again fired upon, one bullet just missing Clawson 's 
head and piercing Kinsey 's hat. Later another ball 
came nigh hitting Clawson and went through Kin- 
sey 's trousers. Both, however, escaped unhurt. 

Meantime, Lieutenant Howland, with something 
of the integrity of a Cortez, had conceived the idea 
of a movable battery, to operate against the In- 
dian redoubt. His idea was at once acted upon. A 
barricade of planks, in the shape of a V, was con- 
structed and placed upon runners, blankets being 
hung loosely on the inside to stop the force of the 
balls that penetrated the timber. The outside was 
covered with brush and boughs to conceal the true 
character of the improvised battery. This pointed 
barricade, behind which quite a number of men could 
take shelter and deliver their fire without being 
much exposed, was pushed towards the Indian 
stronghold. Like Macbeth, when Birnam Wood, or 
what he took to be a forest, came toward Dunsinane, 
the Indians were thoroughly alarmed at the ap- 
proach of this strange object, and divining its pur- 
pose made up their minds to retreat. Accordingly, 
that evening, they opened a furious fire upon the po- 
sition held by the troops, and under cover of the 



34 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

darkness withdrew. The log-house had previously 
been vacated by Kiniball 's men, a circumstance whicL 
enabled the Indians to depart unobserved, after help- 
ing themselves to a supply of horse-beef from the 
dead cavalry animals lying near. 

General Wells, who had been sent for to take 
charge of further operations, arrived next mom ing, 
Feb. 10th, but on preparing to attack the Indians 
it was discovered that they had gone. One party, 
the smaller band, had retreated in the direction of 
Rock Canyon, a rough and difficult gorge a little 
north-east of Provo, while the main party had fled 
southward in the direction of Spanish Fork. A 
dead squaw the one killed by a cannon shot was 
found in the Indian encampment; also two or three 
warriors, dead or dying. . Elk, the chief, subse- 
quently died of wounds received during the siege. 
His being wounded had probably disheartened the 
savages and caused the retreat quite as much as 
Lieutenant Rowland's battery. The lieutenant had 
returned to Salt Lake City after the second day's 
skirpnish. Some of the Indians, more friendly than 
their fellows, had deserted their ranks before the 
fighting began, taking refuge with the white fami- 
lies in the fort. 

Detailing certain men to garrison the stockade, 
and others to pursue the Eock Canyon refugees, Gen - 
eral Wells, with the main body of the cavalry, set 
out upon the trail of the Indians who had gone south- 
ward. At Spanish Fork and Pe-teet-neet (now Pay- 
son) short skirmishes occurred, and eventually, on 
Feb. llth the Indians were overtaken near Table 
Mountain, at the south end of Utah Lake. Another 
battle ensued, and the Indians were practically an- 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 35 

nihilated. Most of the fighting took place on the 
ice, which was very slippery, making it extremely 
difficult for the horses to keep their feet. The In- 
dians, being shot at, would fall, as if dead, and then, 
as their pursuers drew near, rise up and fire. 

They killed several horses in this manner, but 
none of the cavalrymen were hurt. 

Night came down, and a bitter night it was. 
The soldiers were forced to take refuge in the wicki- 
ups vacated by the Indians on the bleak mountain 
side. As these primitive shelters swarmed with ver- 
min the result may readily be imagined. 

On returning to Fort Utah, General Wells found 
that Major Lytle and Captain Lamereux, joining 
their forces, had pursued the other band of Indians 
up Bock Canyon. The fate of these savages was 
similar to that of their fellows at Table Mountain. 
The total Indian loss was about forty, more than 
half the number of warriors engaged Efforts were 
made to civilize the squaws and papooses who were 
captured, but as a rule without avail They lived 
with the whites during the winter, but in the spring 
again sought their native mountains. 

A treaty of peace was entered into between the 
settlers and the Indians, and the latter now agreed 
to be friendly and molest their white neighbors no 
more. 

CHIEF WALKER PLANS TO MASSACRE THE 
PEOPLE. 

In the summer of 1850, Walker, it is said, laid a 
plan to massacre the people at Fort Utah. It was in 
revenge for a slight that he imagined he had received 
from Governor Young. The Ute chief had visited the 



36 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

" Mormon " leader to obtain his permission to engage 
in a campaign against the Shoshones, in which Wal- 
ker wished some of the young men of Provo to join. 
Governor Young would not listen to such a thing, 
and again advised the warlike chief to cease fight- 
ing and bloodshed. Walker retunied to Utah Val- 
ley in a rage. Gathering his band, he was about to 
fall upon the fort, when Sowiette, the white man's 
friend, again interposed to thwart him. He not only 
warned the inmates, who flew to arms, but told Wal- 
ker that he with his band would help the fort against 
him. Walker again gave way, and for several years 
warred elsewhere, not molesting the i l Mormon ' ' set- 
tlements. 

The late Bishop Henson Walker of Pleasant 
Grove, Utah County, Utah, related an incident that 
occurred at the battle at Provo, in which he formed 
a conspicuous figure. He said: "I shot at an In- 
dian sixteen times from behind a log. To do him jus- 
tice, he was equally active. There we were, both 
under cover blazing away at each other, when neither 
showed even a part of his body. But I had the last 
shot. He stuck out too much of his head and never 
got back." 

Copied from ' ' Deseret News ' ' Vol. 1 : 

One white man by the name of Baker was killed 
by Indians on the 29th of May, 1850, between Utah 
and Sanpete Valleys. 

The following summer a successful expedition 
was undertaken by a company of volunteer (cavalry) 
under Captain George D. Grant, against the Goshute 
Indians, a band of renegades who for some time 
had been stealing stock and committing murders in 
Tooele Valley and the surrounding region. Their 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 37 

headquarters were in Skull Valley. Captain Wil- 
liam McBride with a company of infantry had pre- 
ceded the cavalry to that point, but finding it im- 
possible to operate successfully against the Indians 
with his troops, had requested that a force of 
mounted men be sent to his assistance. The Indian 
camp was among the Cedar Mountains, on the west- 
ern edge of a desert, twenty miles wide and very dif- 
ficult to cross, owing to an utter lack of water. A 
first effort to surprise and chastise the savages 
proved futile, as they had learned of the coming of 
the troops and laughed and jeered at them from the 
rocky heights where they were entrenched. A second 
march of the cavalry across the desert, during the 
night, when the Indians supposed the pursuit had 
been abandoned, was completely successful. The 
savages were surprised in their wickiups just at day- 
break, and the males almost annihilated. Tons of 
" jerked beef," manufactured from the stolen cattle 
of the settlers, were found stored in the Indians' 
stronghold. Among those who participated in this 
expedition, which gave many years of peace to the 
western settlements, were George D. Grant, William 
H. Kimball, Robert T. Burton, Nathaniel V. Jones, 
Rodney Badger, James M. Barlow, John Wakely, 
Charles Westover and Jesse Turpin. 

COPIED FROM TULLIDGE'S HISTORIES, 
VOL. H, P. 83. 

1 ' The pioneers of Tooele County had their com- 
plement of trouble with the Indians, in common with 
the early settlers in Utah. "With them," writes 
the Historian Edward W. Tullidge for several years, 
the loss of cattle and horses was frequent and often 



38 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

severe. Scouting after the enemy, standing guard 
and forting up formed an important factor of their 
lives. Many incidents of interest will remain un- 
written, as only a few of the most important events 
can now be gathered up and placed on record. 

In the spring of 1851, some emigrants on their 
way to California were assisting Ezra T. Benson 
to put up a saw-mill at Bichville, (now known as 
the Mill), when a party of the surrounding Indians 
stole their horses. One of them Mr. Ouster, with 
Harrison Severe, Thomas Lee and other " Mormon" 
settlers, followed them, as they supposed, to the west 
side of Rush Lake ; but evidently mistook the route 
the marauders had taken. However, they there found 
a band of Indians with their families, took thorn 
prisoners and started for Tooele, but without dis- 
arming the men. On the way the Indians and con- 
sequently the guard became separated into small 
squads. It appears that Mr. Ouster was a little in 
the rear and south of the town of Tooele when the 
two or three Indians with him made a break in the 
darkness, for it was in the evening, and in the melee 
Ouster was shot. Those ahead of him soon learned 
the fact by his horse coining up with them riderless. 
Some men went back and found his body on a rock 
where he had fallen. The blood-stained rock was a 
witness of the event for many years. His body 
was taken to Salt Lake City for burial. This was 
the first bloodshed connected with Indian difficul- 
ties in the County. Harrison Severe, and perhaps 
others, succeeded in getting five Indian warriors in- 
to Tooele City to a military camp prepared by Cap- 
tain Wright for their reception. 0. P. Rockwell, 
cdrmnonly known as Porter Rockwell, was sent from 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 39 

headquarters and took direction of affairs in this 
Indian trouble. Considering it best to make another 
effort to obtain the stolen horses, he took a party 
of men, and with them the five Indian prisoners and 
went through the mountains west of Grantsville into 
Skull Valley. The prisoners were evidently in sym- 
pathy with their thieving brethern and professed to 
know nothing of those who had stolen the horses. 
Their assertions received no credit from the whites. 
The party formed camp, went on a scout, and left 
Harrison Severe to guard the Indians for some 
twenty-four hours, rather a precarious business for 
one man under the circumstances. 

Rockwell and his men, not finding any trace of 
the stolen horses, deemed it unwise to turn the 
thieves in their power loose to commit more depreda- 
tions and perhaps shed the blood of some useful citi- 
zen, and they were sacrificed to the natural instincts 
of self-defense. 

Soon after the above events the Indians stole 
about one hundred head of cattle from a herd kept 
by Mr. Charles White near Black Rock, at the south 
end of the Salt Lake, drove them past the present 
site of Grantsville, through Skull Valley into the 
mountains west. Some of the cattle being too fat to 
drive, died by the way; the remainder were killed 
and the meat dried and stored in cedar trees. These 
Indians were first pursued by fourteen men from 
Salt Lake City under Captain Wm. McBride. They 
got track of the stolen cattle in the region of Skull 
Valley, but found the Indians too numerous for their 
numbers and they sent an express to Salt Lake City 
for assistance. General James Ferguson and Col- 
onels Geo. D. Grant and Wm. H. Kimball came out 



40 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



from Salt Lake City with forty men, were joined by 
ten more from Toooie City, and ^ith these went after 
the marauders. After considerable scouting and 
several attempts to surprise bands of Indians, while 
on the march early one morning a camp was dis- 
covered in a canyon up the side of a mountain. It 
was approached as near as possible wihout being 
discovered, when the command was given to make 
a rush upon it, every man to do the best he could. 
The best mounted were upon the Indians before 
they could get away, and nine of the warriors 
were killed. Several expeditions from Salt Lake 
City afterwards assisted in the defense of the 
settlements, but there being no records of these 
events it is now difficult to write them. 

Mr. Harrison Severe, one of the first pioneers 
of the County, had ever advocated a kindly policy 
towards the Indians who were not known to be guilty 
of crime. The following circumstance shows the 
wisdom of such a policy, and that the dispised In- 
dian is sometimes capable of gratitude. In the 
Autumn of 1852 he went into the mountains with a 
wagon and two yoke of oxen for timber. Near his 
home was the wicki-up of a friendly Indian whose 
life he had once saved from the vengeance of his 
irate people. This Indian closely followed him into 
the mountains where three or four thieving savages 
were watching the coming of Mr. Severe, and had al- 
ready plotted to kill him and take his oxen. As he 
was unarmed they easily took him prisoner, and 
were proceeding to carry out their bloody purpose, 
when the friendly Indian appeared on the ground, 
placed an arrow in his bow and informed them that 
before dispatching Mr. Severe they would be obliged 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 41 

to kill him. A parley ensued and the robbers were 
imbued with a more kindly feeling. One of them 
went home with Mr. Severe, and the latter sent a 
messenger into Salt Lake City for an interpreter. 
On his arrival a personal treaty was made between 
Mr. Severe and the Indians, after which he always 
went wherever he wished in safety, regardless of the 
difficulties the Indians might have with others. Tne 
last raid made by Indians on the the animals of the 
citizens of Tooele Valley was, doubtless, brought 
about by some thieving white person. 

Not far from Tooele City an Indian Chief 
known as Naraquits had a son, about sixteen years 
old, who sickened and died ; with him, in accordance 
with the custom of his people, he buried a rifle and 
some buckskins for his use. After an absence of 
several weeks he returned to visit the resting place 
of his son to find that some sacrilegious white man 
had robbed the grave. It was but natural that his 
vengeance should be aroused. Shortly after this 
some one hundred horses, mostly belonging to Nay- 
lor and Bringhurst, were driven off. It afterwards 
transpired that they were taken to Fort Bridger and 
sold to U. S. Soldiers, who at the time were stationed 
there. 

In 1864 General Connor's Command was used 
to protect the Overland Mail Coach on the road from 
Stockton west, where the Indians had committed 
some depredations. Detachments guarded all sta- 
tions and a guard of two or three men were killed 
at what was then known as Bunt Station, near where 
the town of Clifton now stands. At one time thirty 
men were stationed at Government Creek for sixty 
days. A little west of the creek Captain A. Smith 



42 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

attacked a band of Indians and killed nine of them. 
The outbreak ended as usual with such affairs. The 
barbarians wasted away, and a miserable remnant 
was glad to make peace on any terms. " (Tullidge's 
Histories, Col. II, pp. 3-85.) 

DEATH OF SQUASH-HEAD. 

The following was written by J. C. Lemmon at 
Ferron, Aug. 6, 1906 : 

' ' James Lemmon was killed by an Indian called 
Squash-head about the middle of May, 1851. Mother 
was helping father to plant beans, when a neighbor 
came to borrow a wash-tub and board ; the man had 
a little girl with him. After giving the man the tub, 
she returned to help father in the lot and did not 
notice that James followed them and that in cross- 
ing the ditch by the fence he fell in and was swept 
down by the stream in the opposite direction. The 
child must have gone down the ditch about a quarter 
of a mile when Squash-head happened along and 
found the child and made off with him. "When the 
alarm was given, all turned out to hunt, but no 
trace of the child could be found. Some time after- 
wards, however, the Indian commenced to brag about 
it, in consequence of which he was arrested and 
taken to Provo. He broke away, but was caught 
again by Joseph Kelly between Spanish Fork and 
Springville and lodged in a house belonging to Bis- 
hop Johnson. While Alex Williams was guarding 
him he told how he killed the child. He had tortured 
the little one by taking off its toes and fingers, and 
finally finished his brutal work by taking him 
by the heels and smashing the back of its head on a 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 43 

rock. The child was twenty months and six days old 
at the time of its death. Williams then killed Squash- 
-head by cutting his throat with a case-knife which he 
had brought in with the Indian's breakfast. At the 
time of the tragedy the child's parents lived at Moun- 
tain ville (now called Alpine), Utah County. ' 

The writer was a brother of the child who was 
killed. Geo. McKenzie, assistant-adjutant general 
of the Utah County War Veterans, said, after read 
ing the above that it was written by some one who 
did not fully understand the whole matter. 

Don C. Johnson says : ' l Squash Head killed him- 
self in the absence of Alex Williams and that it 
happened in Bishop Johnson 's house. ' ' 



CAUSE AND ORIGIN OF THE WALKER WAR.

Having been requested by State commander J. 
M. Westwood of the Utah Indian War Veterans As- 
sociation to write up the cause of the ' l Walker War, ' ' 
having been a resident of Springville at the time, and 
being well acquainted with James Ivie, who was the 
principal actor in the drama that caused the war, I 
submit the following as told to me by Ivie at the time, 
and on several occasions since the war. Walker, 
the war chief of the Ute nation, with his braves and 
their families were camped on Spring creek about 
one mile north of the present town of Springville, 
(Utah Co., Utah) all at peace with the white settlers, 
spending their time fishing and hunting, and trad- 
ing and begging from the people. James Ivie, at 



44 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

that time had built a cabin, and was living in it with 
his wife and one chilol about half a mile north and 
west of where the Indians were camped. In the fore- 
noon of July 17, 1853, an Indian and squaw came in- 
to Ivie's cabin. The squaw had three large trout 
which she wanted to trade to Mrs. Ivie for some flour. 
Flour being very scarce at that time, Mrs. Ivie called 
her husband in to get his views on the trade of that 
kind, he being at work digging a well. When he 
saw the trout, he said "They look mighty good to 
me," and suggested that Mrs. Ivie might give three 
pints of flour for them, if the squaw would trade 
that way. He then went out of the cabin to resume 
his work. Just after Ivie left two more Indians came 
into the cabin, one of whom seemed to be the husband 
or had some kind of claim on the squaw who had 
closed the trade with Mrs. Ivie. When this Indian 
saw the three trout, and the small amount of flour 
received in exchange, he became enraged and began 
beating the squaw, knocking her down, kicking and 
stamping her in a brutal manner. While this assault 
was being committed, Mrs. Ivie ran and called her 
husband, Mr. Ivie came to the cabin, and while the 
Indian was still beating the squaw he took hold of 
the Indian and pulled him away, the squaw lying 
prostrate on the floor. Ivie tried to push the Indian 
out of the cabin. When the Indian came, he left his 
gun standing by the door, and as Ivie pushed him out 
he grabbed his gun and tried to get in position to 
shoot Ivie. Ivie got hold of the muzzle of the gun, 
and in the struggle the gun was broken. The In- 
dian retaining the stock and Ivie the barrel. When 
the gun broke, Ivie dealt tBe Indian a hard blow on 
the head with the barrel of the gun. The Indian fell 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 45 

to the ground, apparently dead, but did not expire 
until some hours later. The other Indian who came 
to the cabin the same time as his companian drew his 
bow and arrow and shot Ivie, the arrow passing 
through the shoulder of Ivie's buckskin hunting 
shirt. At this Ivie struck the Indian a violent blow 
and he fell unconscious by the side of the prostrate 
body of the other Indian. Just as Ivie got through 
with this second Indian, the squaw that he had been 
trying to protect came out of the cabin door with a 
stick of wood in her hand which she had picked up by 
the side of the fire in the cabin. With it she struck 
Ivie a blow in the face cutting a deep gash in his up- 
per lip, and the scar showed plainly from that time 
until his death. Ivie again used the gun barrel to de- 
fend himself and struck the squaw. She fell uncon- 
scious by the side of the prostrate bodies of the two 
Indians. At this stage in the drama Joseph Kelly 
one of the foremost settlers of Springvllle, came 
rpon the scene, and while looking at the three In- 
dians lying apparently dead he was told by Ivie what 
had taken place. Kelly took a bucket of water that 
stood in the cabin and poured it on the Indians, try- 
ing to restore them. He then sent the Indian who 
first came to the cabin with the squaw for another 
bucket of water to try to restore the Indians to life ; 
this Indian having taken no part in the trouble. 

Kelly told Ivie to take his wife and child and 
go into town before the Indian camp was notified of 
the trouble, which he did. 

The Indian that Kelly sent after the water went 
to the Indian camp and told of what had taken place 
at the Ivie cabin. The news of the trouble soon spread 



46 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

through the camp and the settlement of whites. In- 
tense exictement reigned, both in the Indian camp 
and the settlement. 

Bishop Aaron Johnson, who was chief magis- 
trate in all civil and military affairs at Springville, 
took immediate steps to protect the settlement. He 
ordered Caldwell's cavalry and Parry 's infantry to 
be mustered in and be ready for action at call. All 
the other male citizens over sixteen years of age 
were enrolled as a home guard. Johnson with his 
interpreter, Wm. Smith, tried everything in their 
power to settle the trouble with Chief Walker, by 
offering ponies, beef, flour, and blankets, but Walker 
refused to settle unless Ivie was given up to be tried 
by the Indians, which Johnson refused to do. 

The next day (July 18th) Walker broke camp 
and went to Payson; joined his brother Arrapene 
another Indian chief, and together they went into 
Payson canyon, killing Alexander Keele who was on 
guard at the outskirts of Payson, saying, that, the 
war would last until the white people were all ex- 
terminated. The Indians then went into the moun- 
tains east of Sanpete Valley and left their families in 
a place of safety. 

The Indians returning in war paint, raided the 
settlements of Utah, Juab, Sanpete, Millard and 
Iron Counties during the summer and fall. The last 
engagement was at the south end of Utah Lake gen- 
erally spoken of as the Goshen Valley battle, which 
lasted about three hours; the troops taking the In- 
dian camp. Nine Indians were killed; some of the 
troops and horses were shot, but none mortally. 

Some Indians and their families came down 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 47 

Hobble Creek canyon to Springville a short time 
after, saying that the war was over. 

A short time after CaldwelPs cavalry and 
Parry's infantry were released from duty, having 
served a period of ninety-one days ; from July 18th 
to October 15, 1853. 

The treaty of peace was signed by Walker in 

May, 1854, at his camp on Meadow Creek, Juab Co. 

Signed Lieut. Geo. McKenzie, 

Walker died Jan. 29, 1855, at Meadow Creek, 
Millard County, Utah and was buried by his tribe 
with the highest honor that could be given him as the 
most noted war-chief of the nation. 

His brother Arrapeen succeeded him as chief. 

FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE WALKER WAR 

GIVEN BY JOHN W. BERRY OF PALMYRA, 

UTAH COUNTY. 

"On- the 19th of July 1853 the Indians killed 
Alexander Keele at Payson and commenced what is 
called the Walker War. On the 20th of July, Colonel 
Conover, from Provo, in command of a company of 
militia known as the Nauvoo Legion, called at Pal- 
myra and asked for volunteers to join his company 
and defend the settlements not provided with suf- 
ficient guards. Major Stephen Markham, John W. 
Berry and fifteen others went with him as far south 
as Manti. Colonel Conover, wishing to send a mes- 
sage to President Brigham Young, at Salt Lake City, 
to ask for his advice, appointed Clark Roberts, of 
Provo, and John W. Berry as messengers to the 
President. 

These messengers left Manti at 4 o'clock P. M. 
on the 23rd of July 1853, and arrived at Summit 



48 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



Creek, (now Santaquin) about 10 A. M. on the fol- 
lowing day. On their arrival they found the inhabi- 
tants had all moved to Payson for safety and that 
the town was in the possession of the Indians. While 
riding along through the streets of the deserted set- 
tlement, with no thought of the Indians being in full 
possession of the same, they were fired on by twenty 
one Indians, from a house in which they were con- 
cealed. Clark Roberts was shot through the right 
shoulder and John W. Berry in the left wrist. Six 
or seven Indians pursued the two white men on horse- 
back to Spring Lake, where the Payson cow herd was 
stationed under a guard, consisting of five or six 
men. The Indians seeing this guard gave up the 
chase and started back into the mountains. The 
wounded men went on to Payson, where their wounds 
were dressed, and in the afternoon they were con- 
veyed to their homes. When the messengers arrived 
at Palmyra, the citizens were camped in the school 
house. 

On July 23rd, 1853, W. S. Berry and Charles 
Price, who were on guard discovered Indians at- 
tempting to steal cattle, and the savages commenced 
firing upon the guards, Charles Price was 
hit in the right thigh by a bullet, which made a very 
severe flesh wound. For fear of further Indian hos- 
tilities the people from the upper settlement all 
moved to Palmyra where they spent the winter of 
1853-54. Indians stole about fifty or sixty head of 
cattle, among which were a number of oxen, and 
took them up Spanish Fork Canyon to the Warm 
Springs, where they camped all winter and fed upon 
the stolen stock. 

In February, 1854, Captain Hancock of Payson, 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 49 

captured two Indians, one of them being the son 
of Chief Peteetneet. He held the chief 's son a pris- 
oner, and sent the other Indian to the tribe with the 
message that he would hold the chief's son a pris- 
oner until an interview was obtained with the chief. 
On the following morning the chief came and held 
a consultation with the citizens, after which he agreed 
to terms of peace, which in a short time ended the 
Walker War. Governor Brigham Young advised the 
brethern to erect Peteetneet a home in the fort line 
and have him make his home among them. This was 
considered wise counsel, and accordingly the house 
was built ; the chief moved into it and remained until 
the settlement was broken up. 

Silas Hillman of Palmyra, Utah County, makes 
the following statement which is published in Tul- 
lidge's Quarterly Magazine, Vol. 3, page 154. 

It was feared the Indians would attack Sanpete 
County settlements as they appeared to be heading 
that way. The settlements in that county were 
sparse and some were small, and the inhabitants 
knew nothing of the Indians being hostile. There- 
fore, a council of war was decided to follow the In- 
dians and get to Sanpete as soon as possible. 
We started next morning. I took command 
of the cavalry company, of Palmyra, being 
lieutenant of said company; the captain staying at 
home left me in command. This was on the 21st of 
July, 1853. "When we arrived in Sanpete Valley, 
the main body of troops kept straight on for Manti 
City, but I, with my company, was detailed to go 
around to the Allred settlement, afterwards called 
Springtown. We saw some fresh signs of Indians, 
but no Indians. We found the families gathered to- 



50 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



gether and a board fort put up around them a 
rather flimsy fort to stop bullets. We camped with 
them that night, during which one or two Indians 
were seen skulking around. Our boys shot at them, 
but I do not think they hit them ; it raised the alarm 
however, and every man w r as at his post ready for a 
fight, but no Indians came. 

We advised the few settlers of Springtown to 
move down to Manti City, but they said they could 
take care of themselves. 

We had been ordered to make for the main army 
to report what we had discovered of the situation of 
affairs in that section of the country, therefore, the 
next morning we took up our line of march for 
Manti, where we arrived the same day in the after- 
noon, joined the main army consisting of about two 
hundred men under command of Colonel Markham 
and Conover. 

"We stopped at Manti seven or eight days, dur- 
ing which time companies were scouting the country 
in every direction in search of Indians. One of our 
companies ran across a camp of thirty or forty In- 
dians and had a brush with them. Some of the In- 
dians were killed ; the balance retreated. 

Another party of the Indians came down the 
canyon to the mill, a short distance above Manti, in 
the night. After this discovery was made, a strong 
guard was kept up in the mouth of the canyon. One 
night I had command of a company doing guard 
service and Captain Chidester had charge of another 
in the mill below us, where the road came down the 
canyon. It was a very steep place, and a thick under- 
growth of young pines grew close to the road. We 
concealed ourselves along the road in this under- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 51 

growth and watched all night for Indians, having 
planned to let the Indians pass us; and when they 
should reach the mill Captain Chidester's company 
was to attack them and drive them back for us to 
attack them. Thus they would have been attacked 
both in the front and rear ; but we got no chance to 
put our plans into action, for the Indians never came. 

" After we had been away about twelve days, we 
received orders from the Lieutenant-General to re- 
turn home. The first night after we left we encamp- 
ed at the springs north of Nephi City. That night 
the Indians tried to drive off our horses, which were 
feeding, but our guard being strong around the 
horses prevented the Indians from getting them, 
and fired pretty lively for a short time ; the balance 
of the guard with the camp surrounded the horses 
and drove them into a corral, which had been left 
standing when the inhabitants evacuated the settle- 
ment and took shelter in the city of Nephi. The next 
morning we saw some blood, but no dead Indians. 
Next day we reached Palmyra. During the summer 
and fall we had to keep up a vigilant watch against 
the Indians. While we were in Sanpete, Indians 
were lurking around Palmyra. One man by the name 
of Price was shot in the knee; also one of our men 
(John W. Berry), sent home with an express, was 
shot at Summit Creek through the hand. The In- 
dians drove off the Allred settlement's stock, and 
during the season killed several men in Sanpete. 
One man was also killed at Summit Creek. 

We had another expedition, Sept 26th, of a 
couple of days after Indians at Salt Greek, in Go- 
shen Valley. We came to an Indian camp just at day 
break and took the savages by surprise. As they 



52 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



begged for peace, we told them if they would give 
up their arms and go to the settlements, we would 
not hurt them. We dallied with them for some time, 
as they did not like to give up their arms, that being 
the last thing an Indian will part with. But at last 
Colonel Markham gave them five minutes to decide. 
Not complying with his order the colonel gave the 
order for our company to attack. The Indians re- 
turned the fire very lively for some time, but our 
men pressed them so hard that they soon silenced 
the firing of the Indians. Those of them that were 
not killed retreated into a cane swamp and got away. 
Casualties on our side were small, considering the 
smartness of fire of the Indians. One man (Bishop 
Charles Hancock) was slightly wounded in the head, 
and one horse shot in the hip. The Indians being 
in the cane and in the swamp dragged their dead 
in there; Consequently we could not tell how many 
were killed. 

After peace was made they told us we only 
wounded two or three; but they reported at Nephi 
that we killed nineteen or twenty of them. 

They made a haul of sixty or seventy head of 
cattle from our place late in the fall and during the 
fore part of the winter, while the cattle were running 
two or three miles up the creek from Palmyra; the 
owners thought it was so late in the fall that there 
was no danger of Indians disturbing them ; but they 
nevertheless, came down from the canyon over to 
Palmyra and took some out of our corrals, and took 
all they could find up the creek and got away with 
them to Uintah Valley. After peace was made they 
returned what they had not killed and eaten.

THE WALKER WAR CONTINUED. TREACHERY OF 

THE INDIANS. 
From Whitney's History of Utah, Vol. 1, p. 514. 

"On July 18th, 1853, Walker, with a number of 
warriors, rode down to Fort Payson, whose inhabi- 
tants, thinking no evil, received the red men kindly, 
and as usual gave them food. The Indians made no 
hostile movement until they started back to camp in 
the evening, when they shot and killed Alexander 
Keele, who was standing guard near the fort. Know- 
ing well what would follow, Arapeen hastened back 
to his brother and told him what had been done. 

Walker immediately ordered his followers to 
pack their wigwams and retreat up Payson Canyon, 
which they did. Several families of settlers were 
then living in the canyon. Upon these the savages 
fired as they passed, but were evidently in too great a 
hurry, fearing pursuit, to do serious execution. 

The people of Payson on their part, expecting a 
general attack from the Indians, at once flew to arms. 
They also sent messengers to Provo to apprise the 
military authorities there of what had occurred, and 
request immediate reinforcement. Colonel Peter W. 
Conover, who still commanded the militia in Utah 
County, hastily gathered about a hundred and fifty 
men, and proceeded at once to Payson. He arrived 
there July 20th. Troops from Spanish Fork and 
Springville were already on the ground. 

A council of war convened, consisting of Colonel 
Conover and his associate officers, and it was decid- 
ed to follow in the tracks of the savages, who, it was 
feared, intended to attack the Sanpete settlements. 
Leaving the infantry to garrison the Payson fort, the 



54 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

cavalry, under Colonel Conover and Lieutenant 
Markham, at once set out for Manti. These move- 
ments were doubtless in accordance with orders from 
headquarters. General Daniel H. Wells, at Salt Lake 
City, having been apprised of the situation, had dis- 
patched Lieutenant-Colonel William H. Kimball with 
a hundred mounted men to join Colonel Conover at 
Pay son. 

Meantime, simultaneous attacks had been made 
by Indians at various points. 

At Springville, in a second assault upon that set- 
tleiment, William Jolley was shot and wounded in the 
arm. At Nephi, in Juab County, cattle were stolen 
and the guard fired upon, while similar depredations 
were committed at Pleasant Creek and Manti in San- 
pete County. (This was July 19th.) 

On July 20th the Guard at Nephi, Juab County, 
was fired upon by Indians. 

Colonel Conover, on reaching Sanpete, left some 
of his men at each settlement to protect it against 
the Indians, who were now raiding and running off 
stock in all directions. Arriving at Manti and secur- 
ing that place against attack, Conover 's command 
divided and companies were sent out to scour the 
surrounding country in quest of redskins. One of 
these detachments, under Lieutenant-Colonel Jabez 
Nowlin, who it will be remembered was wounded 
in the two days ' fight at Provo, came upon a band 
of twenty or thirty Indians near Pleasant Creek on 
the 23rd of July. Being hailed by an interpreter and 
asked if they were friends or foes, the savages 
admitted that they were enemies, and without wait- 
ing to be attacked fired upon the troopers. Nowlin 
then ordered a charge, and the Indians, after the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 55 

first fire, broke and fled, leaving six or seven of 
their number dead upon the field. Nowlin's com- 
pany sustained no loss. 

Colonel Conover now dispatched messengers to 
request further orders from General Wells. The 
messengers sent were Clark Roberts of Provo, and 
John W. Berry of Spanish Fork. Leaving Manti in 
the afternoon on the 23rd, they reached Summit 
Creek Santaquin in Utah County, next morning. 
They found the place deserted, the settlers, fearing 
attack and massacre, having sought safety at Payson. 
As the messengers rode through the town they were 
fired upon by twenty-one Indians concealed in some 
houses. Berry was shot in the left wrist, and Roberts 
through the shoulder. Putting spurs to their horses 
they rode at full speed toward Payson, hotly pur- 
sued by the Indians, from whom, however, they suc- 
ceeded in escaping. " 

COLONEL GEORGE A. SMITH GIVEN 
COMMAND OF THE MILITIA. 

On the 25th of July, Colonel George A. Smith 
was given command of all the militia in the Territory 
south of Salt Lake, with instructions to take pro-mpt 
and thorough measures for the defense and safety 
of the various settlements. The policy he was di- 
rected by Governor Young to pursue was to gather 
all the inhabitants into forts, corralling their stock 
and surrounding it with armed guards. No acts of 
retaliation or offensive warfare upon the red men 
were to be permitted; but on the contrary a concilia- 
tory course towards them was to be maintained. At 
the same time vigilant watch was to be kept, and 
such Indians as were caught attempting to steal or 



56 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



kill, were to be summarily punished. These instruc- 
tions Colonel Smith executed with his usual fidelity, 
and though it entailed much labor upon the settlers 
to put themselves in a proper state of defense, the 
wisdom of the policy, evident at the outset, was 
speedily confirmed. Those who failed to follow the 
instructions suffered heavily from the raids of the 
Indians. 

ATTACK ON WILLOW CEEEK, (MONA). 
ISAAC DUFFIN WOUNDED. 

August 10th. Lieutenant R. Burns and a com- 
pany of ten men, encamped at a small settlement on 
Willow Creek Mona in Juab County, were attack- 
ed by Indians, and during the fight that followed, 
Isaac Duf fin was slightly wounded in the knee. Two 
of the soldiers had their horses killed, and one In- 
dian was sent to the "happy hunting grounds. " 
About this time Colonel Conover was ordered back 
from Sanpete to guard the settlements of Utah 
County and assist in putting them in better condi- 
tion of defense. 

AT PARLEY'S PARE, TWO MEN KILLED, 
ONE WOUNDED. 

On the 17th of August, four men John Dixon, 
John Quayle, John Hoagland and John Knight, 
were hauling lumber from Snyder's saw-mill in Par- 
ley's Park, when they were fired upon by Indians in 
ambush and two of them instantly killed. These 
were John Quayle and John Dixon. Hoagland was 
wounded in the arm, but was able to help Knight 
detach two of their horses, upon which they rode with 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 57 



all speed to Salt Lake City. Barely escaping with 
their lives; they left their wagon, four horses, two 
mules, and the dead bodies of their companions be- 
hind them. Their savage assailants did not linger 
long in the neighborhood of the massacre, not even 
long enough to scalp or otherwise mutilate the dead, 
according to their custom. Taking the animals they 
hastily decamped, and though followed by an armed 
party from Salt Lake City, as soon as the news of 
the killing reached there, they were nowhere to be 
found, though diligently sought for in all the sur- 
rounding region. Another John Dickson, the spell- 
ing of whose name slightly differs from that of the 
i other man killed in Parley 's Canyon, had been shot 
| by Indians near Snyder's Mill a short time before. 

The situation now became so serious that travel- 
ling from settlement to settlement, unless accom- 
panied by a strong guard, was extremely perilous. 

Though the Utah Indians had taken the initia- 
tive, other tribes or parts of tribes were also begin- 
ning to engage in the war, shooting and stealing 
I stock in various section of the Territory. Governor 
Young, on the 19th of August, issued a proclama- 
jtion forbidding the sale of fire-arms and ammuni- 
tion to the Utah Indians and calling upon the offi- 
cers of the militia in the several districts to hold their 
commands in readiness to march at any moment 
against the murderous marauders. 

Colonel George A. Smith returned to Salt Lake 

City from Iron County on the 22nd of August. He 

I reported that the southern settlements generally 

I were in an excellent state of defense, and that the 

inhabitants were on the alert in relation to the sava- 



58 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

ges. He had been assisted in his labors by Apostle 
Franklin D. Richards, who was traveling through 
southern Utah on public business, and returned north 
with Colonel Smith. Two days later Lieutenant- 
Colonel William H. Kimball, who had also rendered 
important service in Iron County, came back from 
the south. He and his men had been followed closely 
and watched by Indians for several days, but heed- 
ing the Governor's instructions they had not taken 
the offensive, and the savages, seeing that they were 
prepared, did not attack thdm. 

As a means of defense and an example to other 
settlements during the Indian troubles of 1853, the 
authorities at Salt Lake City decided to build a 
"Spanish Wall" around the town. The project was 
first mentioned by President Young in a meeting of 
the Bishops held at the Council House in the latter 
part of August. The City Council then took up the 
matter and the same month a committee consisting 
of Albert Carrington, Parley P. Pratt and Franklin 
D. Richards submitted a report to the council sug- 
gesting the line of the proposed wall around the city. 
It was to stand twelve feet high and be six feet 
through the base, tapering to a thickness, half way 
up, of two-and-a-half feet, and preserving the same 
thickness to the summit. Gates and bastions were to 
"be placed at suitable intervals, and the wall, which 
was to be built entirely of earth, was to be about nino 
miles long. It was never completed, but fragments 
of the portion finished may yet be seen on the north- 
ern outskirts of the city, a reminder of the early days 
that witnessed its erection. Subsequently many of 
the outlying settlements of the Territory built simi- 
lar walls for their protection. 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 59 

WILLIAM HATTON KILLED WHILE 
STANDING GUARD AT FILLMORE. 

Still the Indian war went on. At Fillmore, on 
the 13th day of September, William Hatton, while 
standing guard, was shot and killed by the savnges 
Pah-vants who, catching from the Utes the infec- 
tion of the hour, had begun stealing and killing in 
that locality. 

COL. MARKHAM'S BRUSH AT GOSHEN. 
C. B. HANCOCK WOUNDED. 

On September 26th, Colonel Steven Markham 
and his men had a brush with the redskins near Go- 
shen, Utah County, in which C. B. Hancock wae> 
wounded, and a number of Indians killed. Six days 
later, in another skirmish at Nephi, eight more sav- 
ages were slain and two or three captured. 

THE GUNNISON MASSACRE. 

Copied from (Lights and Shadows of Mormonism) 
by J. F. Gibbs. 

' ' The attention of the traveler on the road from 
Deseret, Millard County, Utah to Nevada, will very 
likely be drawn toward a cedar post that occupies an 
unusual position a few rods north of the Sevier 
Eiver, and a hundred feet from the east side oP a 
shallow lake. The place, which covers about ten acres 
is about six miles west of Deseret, Millard County, 
Utah, with no habitation within several miles. The 
rough bark has been removed from the post, other- 
wise there is nothing in its appearance to attract at- 
tention except its isolated position. Yet, the spot 
over which that solitary post stands sentinel is his- 



60 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

toric and tragic it is the burial place of a small 
party of employees of the United States, where, 
over forty years ago, Captain Gunnison and a por- 
tion of his military escort fell easy victims to a 
band of revengeful Indians. 

"The memorable spot is situated nearly midway 
in the Pahvant valley, about thirty miles west of the 
Canyon range, and twenty-five miles east of the 
House mountains. 

"Except where narrowed in by encroaching 
mountains, the valley stretches out in an almost un- 
broken plain to the great Salt Lake, one hundred 
and fifty miles distant to the north. 

"About two miles to the south, the monotony of 
the desert-like plain is relieved by a basaltic mesa, t> 
dark volcanic mass which rises abruptly from the 
level country to a height of perhaps two hundred 
feet, the surface of which was swept by the waves of 
ancient Lake Bonneville, until it is nearly as smooth 
as the surrounding plain. 

"Dotting the valley in the vicinity are numerous 
shallow lakes, formed by the overflow of the Sevier 
Eiver whose sinuous trails across the valley is in- 
dicated by patches of scrub willows. 

"The small lake first mentioned, is separated 
from the river by a small strip of ground occupied 
by grass and willows which abound in the immediate 
vicinity, both sides of the river ( which is only four to 
six rods wide) being fringed with them. Rising grad- 
ually from the lake towards the north and east, the 
ground is three to five feet higher than the surface 
of the water, and is covered with a stunted growth 
of grease wood and shadscale, (the local name given 
to a low-growing thorny shrub). Patches of saline

land glisten in the sunlight, and under the transform- 
ations wrought by the western mirage are often mis- 
taken for bodies of water. 

"At the time of the massacre the present lake 
was marshy ground covered with flags, rushes and a 
rank growth of grass which extended well out to- 
wards the higher ground, thus forming an inviting, 
but dangerous nook. At the present time nothing re- 
mains of the willows on the east and west sides of 
the dead swamps. 

In other respects the place and its surroundings 
have nearly the same appearance as on that fateful 
afternoon when Captain Gunnison went into camp 
for the last time. 

"The scene of the tragedy has been thus min- 
ately described to enable the reader to more clearly 
understand why the Captain whose reputation for 
courage has never been questioned and his little 
band of brave companions failed to make even a sem- 
blance of resistance, and because no description of 
the place has heretofore appeared in print. Cap- 
tain Gunnison 's brother, when the locality was de- 
scribed to him several years ago in Salt Lake City, 
said he had always imagined the place to be in, or 
near, the mouth of the canyon from which the river 
debouched upon the plain. 

"In the year of the massacre, 1853, Fillmore, 
was the capital of Utah, and the nearest settlement 
to the scene of the tragedy, being distant thirty-fivo 
miles southeasterly. A few of the old settlers yet re- 
main who remember the occurrence. Among the old- 
timers is Byron Warner, now residing at Oasis, and 
who is not only familiar with the incidents of the 



62 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



Illlllllllllllllllllllllll 



tragedy, and well acquainted with the Indians who 
participated therein, but with the circumstances of 
which the Gunnison massacre was the unhappy re- 
sult. 

" And it is to Mr. Warner that the writer is most 
deeply indebted for that part of the account of the 
unfortunate occurrence. 

"Mr. Warner's statement has been corroborated 
by Daniel Thompson, now residing at Scipio, and 
who in company with Mr. Warner and others, helped 
to bury the dead. But three of the Indians that were 
present and took an active part in the bloody deed 
yet linger on this side of the "happy hunting 
grounds. " One of them is old Mareer, who, with his 
squaw Mary, and old Sam, another of the surviving 
reds, is living in a wickiup on some otherwise vacant 
ground southwest, of Deseret. By the aid of two 
rough maps placed before Mareer on two separate 
days, and with the assistance of some small coins and 
other presents of tobacco, etc, and after assuring the 
old fellow that the Mericats (Americans) wouldn't 
be mad, the story of the attack was drawn from him. 

"That his story is perfectly truthful is proved 
by the fact that at the second interview a new map 
was spread before him and the relative positions of 
the white men and Indians were accurately indicated 
as compared with the first map, and no amount of 
cross-questioning could shake his clear and vivid de- 
scription of the attack and its blood-curdling details. 

' l Early in October, 1853, a company of Missouri 
emigrants, en route to California, passed through 
Fillmore and camped on Meadow Creek, eight miles 
to the southwest. 

"A small band of Pahvant Indians were also 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 63 



camped further up towards the mountains on the 
same creek as the emigrant train. 

"Anson Call was at that time bishop of Fill- 
more, and when the emigrants passed through, told 
them they would find a few of the reds camped on 
Meadow Creek, that they were friendly, and the com- 
pany need have no apprehension of danger, and 
asked that the Indians be not molested. 

"The train had hardly gone into camp 
when Moshoquop (the Pahvant war chief and his 
father, Mareer) and several others of the band, ar- 
rived at the camp of the strangers and offered to 
"swap" buckskins for tobacco and other articles. 

"The emigrants were unnecessarily suspicious 
of the bows and arrows carried by the Indians, for 
they surrounded the reds and attempted to disarm 
them. The Indians resisted what they regarded as 
an unwarranted intrusion of their rights. One of 
them "jabbed" an arrow into the breast of one of 
the emigrants, which so enraged them that, whipping 
out their revolvers, they opened fire on the Indians. 
In the melee, the father of Moshoquop was shot in the 
side and died the next day. Two of the other Indians 
were wounded, one in the shoulder and the other in 
the arm. Of the white men all escaped injury except 
the one who received the slight wound in the breast 
form the arrow thrust. 

"A few days after his father 's death, Mosho- 
quop and a band of about twenty Indians moved 
northwesterly to the vicinty of the lakes near the 
present site of Desert for the purpose, as Mareer 
said, of hunting ducks, and crossing the Sevier Eiver, 
camped a little to the northwest of the site of the 
present residence of David Crafts at Ingersol, and 



64 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



about twelve miles northeast of Sevier Lake, and six 
miles west of the place where Gunnison and his party 
were afterwards murdered. 

There were six wicki-ups, or tepees, and among 
the band were many Indians whose names are fami- 
liar to the old residents of Millard County. They 
are: Moshoquop, Pants (the brother of Moshoquop), 
Mareer and his brother Jim, Carboorits, Nunkibo- 
olits, Tomwants and his son Koonants, Skipoke, 
"Doctor Jacob, " Wahbits, Moab, Sam, (Toady), 
Hunkootoop, Boquobits, and an unusually tricky 
red, Jimmy Knights, well known to the early stock- 
raisers by his thieving propensities and the boldness 
he exhibited in killing their stock. 

There were also in the band two Snake Valley 
Indians, a Ute buck from Nephi, one whose name can- 
not be learned, and the father of Mareer; in all, a 
band of twenty-three warriors. 

During the year 1853, Captain Gunnison, with a 
small military escort under command of Captain 
E. M. Morris, had been exploring for a railroad route 
through the Rocky Mountains ; in the latter part of 
October, Gunnison and his escort entered Pahvant 
valley from the north and camped on Pioneer creek, 
six mies north of Fillmore. Gunnison, with a few of 
his party, went into the small settlement of Fillmore 
for supplies. The captain lost no time in hunting 
up Mr. Call, with whom he was acquainted, a warm 
friendship having existed between them for several 
years, and from him learned of the killing of Mosho- 
quop 's father by the emigrants a few days previous. 
Mr. Call also warned the captain of probable danger, 
as the Indians, with threats of revenge, had left their 
camp at Meadow Creek, Gunnison expressed sorrow

over the unfortunate affair, and said the Indians 
would very likely carry out their threats at the first 
opportunity. Being so near the Sevier Lake the 
dead sea of Millard County Gunnison resolved to 
explore it and then to go on to Salt Lake City and 
establish winter quarters. 

Breaking camp on pioneer creek, the party pro- 
ceeded a few miles north to the present site of Holden 
where they left the territorial road and bore north- 
westerly. Passing the southern termination of the 
Canyon range, the party continued on over the desert 
to the Sevier River and camped on a large bottom 
surrounded by high, precipitous banks, known at the 
present time as Gunnison 's Bend, and situated about 
five miles northeast of Deseret. 

On the morning of October 25th Captain Gun- 
nison started on his last and fatal mission of explora- 
tion. Accompanying him were B. A. Kern, artist 
and topographer; F. Creutzfeldts, botanist; Wm. 
Potter, a Mormon guide and interpreter from Manti, 
Sanpete County, Utah; a man who served as cook; 
a corporal and six men. 

The provisions and camp outfit were packed on 
an improvised cart, the tongue and front wheels of a 
wagon which was well adapted to the purpose. Cap- 
tain Morris and a part of the escort were to continue 
in camp until the return of the Gunnison party. 
Meanwhile some of Morris's men were to examine 
the northwestern part of the valley as to the feasi- 
bility of a wagon road through to the Great Salt 
Lake. 

Following down the north side of the river in a 
southwesterly direction, the Gunnison party arrived 
in the vicinity of the upper lakes, where some of the 



66 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

men began shooting at wild f awl which fairly swarin- 
ed in that vicinity. The firing was most unfortu- 
nate, as the reports of firearms reached the ears of 
Sam and Toady, two of Moshoquop's dusky band, 
who were hunting ducks along the river and sloughs. 
The Indians watched the little party until they went 
into camp on the ground now marked by the cedar 
post, when they hastened to the Indian camp and 
reported the presence of strangers. 

Wm. Potter, the guide advised the Captain to make 
camp further to the ndrth on open and higher ground. 
His familiarity with the traits of the Indians led him 
to be suspicious of the surroundings, but his prudent 
advise was overruled. There is something in the 
nature of men that impels them, when camping near 
a spring or stream of water, to get as near to it as 
practicable. 

The horses were "picketed" along the margin of 
the swamp to the north and northwest, and after the 
usual camp duties were over, and the last of the 
stories of exciting "Western life had been told, the 
little party spread their blankets on the ground and 
retired for the night with no apprehension of the 
terrible fate that awaited them. On receiving the 
news of the white men, Moshoquop determined to 
avenge the death of his father. Calling his band of 
warriors together, he told them his purpose and ex- 
plained in detail the plan of attack which was to begin 
at the firing of a signal gun. Each warrior was in- 
structed as to the position he would occupy in the 
deadly cordon that was to be drawn around the slum- 
bering explorers. It was about midnight when the 
line of march began. In single file they moved silent- 
ly and swiftly forward, and as the dusky line glided 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 67 

in a sinuous course to avoid clumps of stunted 
grease-wood and willows it resembled the lithe 
movements of a huge serpent. 

The reds followed up the north bank of the river 
until they reached the western margin of the swamp 
which separated them from their victims, where 
the band divided. Moshoquop, Pants, Mareer, Nun- 
kiboolits and several others continued on up the 
river bank. Stealthily creeping through the willows 
and tall grass, the Indians took their pre-arranged 
stations to the south and east of the Gunnison party 
and not over one hundred feet distant. 

The white men had beaten quite a distinct trail 
from their camp to the river. Carboorits skulked 
in the grass a few yards west of the trail on the bank 
of the river, while Pants crept to a position on the 
margin of the swamp, and not over thirty yards 
distant from the smouldering camp-fire; each sav- 
age being concealed in the rank grass and willows. 

The other portion of the band skirted the west 
side of the swamp, and bending easterly, cautiously 
crept to the north of the low lying ridge which is 
not more than five feet higher than the marsh. 
Each Indian took the position previously assigned 
him, and before the faintest streak of dawn ap- 
peared, the doomed explorers were nearly sur- 
rounded by the wily savages who occupied the east, 
north and south sides of the camp, while the marsh 
cut off escape on the west. The first sign of activity 
on the part of the white men occurred just before 
sunrise. The cook was the first to arise, and in a 
few minutes the cheery gleam of the camp-fire shot 
upward, warning the men that no time was to be 



68 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

wasted in preparing for the morning meal. The 
iron tripod had been placed over the fire, the camp 
kettle hung in its position, the cook had begun mix- 
ing bread. Prof Creutzfeldt was standing near the 
camp-fire warming himself, Captain Gunnison had 
walked out to the river, about seventy-five feet south 
from the camp-fire, and while in a sitting position, 
was bathing his hands and face. The sun had just 
risen from behind the distant canyon range when 
Pants stealthily rose from his place of concealment 
near the edge of the swamp, a sharp report rang out 
on the crisp air and the cook fell dead beside his 
camp-fire. 

Carboorits had been watching the captain and 
waiting for the deadly signal. Startled by the report, 
Gunnison sprang to his feet and the bullet from Car- 
boorits ' gun sped past him. Quickly pulling his six- 
shooter, the captain opened fire on his copper- 
colored assailant, who ducked and dodged to escape 
injury. The signal gun was followed by the rapid 
firing of nearly a dozen guns intermingled by the 
piercing war-whoop of the savages. 

The surprise was complete, and the dazed of- 
ficers and men thought only of escape. Amid the 
shower of whizzing arrows which followed the empty- 
ing of the guns, the men ran toward the open ground 
to the north and northeast, and in the desperate race 
for life, threw aside their arms and divested them- 
selves of coats and everything that might impede 
their flight. 

A few of the men fled in the direction of the 
horses. One of the soldiers, as he was about to 
mount, caught sight of an Indian as he was adjusting 
an arrow to his bow. With exceptional coolness the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 69 

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIItlllllllllllllllllllllllltllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllMli 

man quickly lowered his gun on the savage and fired. 
The Indian dropped, and the soldier rode away be- 
lieving he had killed Mm. (Old Mareer says the 
wily redskin fell as the gun fired, and escaped with- 
out injury, and that not an Indian was wounded), 
Two others of the escort succeeded in mounting, one 
of them escaped on horesback, the other was thrown 
fro.m his horse a short distance east of the camp, but 
had the good sense to remain quiet for several hours 
while the reds were passing to and fro, sheltered only 
by the stunted greasewood. The fourth man that 
escaped ran southeasterly, evaded his pursuers, and 
plunged into the river, swam to the south bank, 
where, within the friendly shadow of the willows, he 
continued his flight to the camp of Captain Morris. 

The Indians who had taken positions to the north 
made no sign until the fleeing men were nearly onto 
them, when they sprang to their feet and with fierce 
yells poured a volley of arrows into the panic-strick- 
en men, who, no doubt, were congratulating them- 
selves on their escape. 

Captain Gunnison, after emptying his revolver 
at Carboorits, turned in the direction of the horses 
and had reached a point about seventy-five yards 
distant from the camp when he fell, stricken down 
by nearly a score of arrows. Temporarily screened 
by grass and willows, he lay helpless while the cries 
of his comrades and the discordant war-cries of 
the savages resounded in his ears. Some two or three 
hours later he was discovered by a party of the reds, 
among whom was Mareer, and who described in pan- 
tomime the last act of the terrible tragedy. Gunni- 
son was lying on his side, and when the Indians ap- 
peared, slowly and painfully raised himself to a bit- 



70 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

ting posture. He made no sound, but reached out 
his arms in an appealing manner towards his as- 
sailants. 

Gunnison, in his several years of exploring in 
the west, had endeavored to impress upon the red 
men that he was their friend. In his conduct to- 
wards them he was uniformly kind and upright, and 
it was this fact that probably prompted the captain 
to extend his arms, possibly, with the hope of mercy. 

Mareer said he did not know, until he saw the 
captain partly rise from the ground, that he was 
with the party. Moshoquop was not present or he 
might, possibly, have given Gunnison a chance to 
recover from his wounds. As it was, the Indians 
hesitated, the captain's mute appeal seemed to stir 
some latent feeling, or strike a stranger cord in their 
savage natures. But while standing there undecided 
"Jirri-my Knights, " the renegade Indian, came up, 
discharged his gun into Captain Gunnison 's body 
which settled slowly back upon the sward, and one 
of the bravest and best spirits joined his comrades 
in the mysterious beyond. 

During the afternoon of the day of the tragedy, 
one of the fugitives staggered into the camp of Cap- 
tain Morris and told the story of the attack, and 
stated that all but himself were slain. In a few min- 
utes the two who had escaped on horses arrived and 
corroborated the story of the massacre. 

Hurriedly mounting, the Morris party rode 
down the river. Darkness coming on, they dismount- 
ed in the vicinty of their lifeless comrades, and hold- 
ing their horses by the bridles, kept vigil throughout 
the long night which was rendered more dismal by 
the howling of the wolves which had begun the work 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 71 

MIMIIIIIIIIMMIIIIIIIIIIIMIHIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIUIIIIM 

of mutilating the bodies of the slain. In the dim light 
of the early morning, one of the survivors guided 
Captain Morris to the camp ground, the bodies were 
identified and their positions mentally recorded. 

The dreary night had been a severe strain on 
the men, and the spectacle of the mutilated bodies 
of their friends was so terrible and suggestive as 
to completely unnerve them. The stampede that 
ensued was more like that of men pursued by the bul- 
lets and yells of those who had made the previous 
morning memorable by their savagery than a com- 
pany of armed men leaving behind them the forms 
of their stricken comrades. Overcoats, knapsacks, 
carbines, revolvers and ammunition marked the 
trail of their frenzied flight and added to the booty 
previously secured by the Indians. 

The news of the massacre reached Fillmore, and 
Bishop Anson Call sent Daniel Thompson, William 
and Culbert King, to Salt Lake City with a dispatch 
announcing the deplorable event. 

Meanwhile, Captain Morris and remnant of his 
command had reached Salt Lake City, and sent the 
corporal who, twenty-four hours after the massacre, 
went over the ground and helped to identify the re- 
mains, down to Fillmore. On his arrival, some ten 
days after the tragedy, Bishop Call selected George 
Black, Daniel Thompson, John King, Lewis Barthol- 
omew, Byron Warner, and as Mr. Warner believes 
Nelson Crandall, now of Springville, Chief Kanosh 
and Narrient of the Pahvant tribe to go with them 
to the scene of the massacre. 

Messrs Warner and Thompson describe the 
sight as the most pitiable they ever saw. About 
twelve days had elapsed between the morning of tho 



72 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

massacre and the arrival of the burial party. The 
coyotes had so mutilated the dead that nothing ze- 
mained of the small party of explorers but glisten- 
ing skeletons. In some instances a leg, arm or foot 
could not be found. The remains of Potter were 
nearly intact. Those of Captain Gunnison were 
more readily recognized by the iron gray hair which 
clung to his temples. The remains of Prof. Creutz- 
feldt were found near those of the cook, who was the 
first to perish. A steel-pointed arrow had pierced 
the body of Creutzfeldt and the barb was found im- 
bedded in his backbone. Some of the men had reach- 
ed a distance of about one third of a mile to the north 
east before being killed. 

Immediately after the arrival of the Fillmore 
party, Kanosh sent Narrient down the river in search 
of Moshoquop and his band, and gave orders to come 
in if they could be found. 

In those days not a member of the Pahvant tribe 
dared to disobey the intrepid chief, and as Mr. Call 
and his party were rounding up the top of the com- 
mon grave, Moshoquop and his band came in sight 
across the swamp on their ponies. Circling the 
marsh they came on whipping, kicking and leaning 
from side to side and yelling like demons. The reds 
were in their war paint, and with their long black 
hair streaming behind, presented a wild appearance. 

The corporal, who was not acquainted with the 
absolute power wielded by the Indian chiefs, thought 
another massacre would be perpetrated, and trem- 
bled like an aspen. Mr. Warner, who is a very ner- 
vy man, and accustomed to the ways of the Indians, 
says his sensations were anything but agreeable. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 73 

However, when within a few rods of the scene of 
their murderous work, a motion from Kanosh 
caused them to be quiet, when he upbraided them for 
their devilish work. 

Moshoquop then told the partial story of the 
massacre, and endeavored to exonerate himself by 
relating the circumstances of his father's death at 
the hands of the white men. Mr. Warner asserts 
that during the recital, tears streamed from Mosho- 
quop's eyes and that his appearance was a mixture 
of fiend incarnate and savage affection. 

The remains of Captain Gunnison and Wm. Pot- 
ter were wrapped in blankets and taken to Fillmore 
where the captain was buried; those of Potter were 
sent to Manti for interment. 

Of the three surviving Indians, Carboorits, who 
shot at the Captain, has lost his eyesight, and is end- 
ing his days in darkness on the Indian farm near the 
town of Kanosh. Mareer and Sam, as previously 
stated, are living near Deseret. Mareer is fast has- 
tening to the grave, and Sam is a muttering imbe- 
cile. 

Moshoquop died two years ago in Deseret. He 
was of medium stature, compactly built, and as lithe 
and wiry as a pather. His forehead was high and 
retreating, his bearing reserved and dignified, his 
face, while indicating strength and a fearless nature, 
was frank and not unkind. In spite of the terrible 
deed he planned and carried out so relentlessly, he 
was better than the average Indian. While his part in 
the Gunnison tragedy cannot be justified by revenge 
for the death of his father, it is somewhat palli ated 
by reflecting that his nature like that of all other

Indians was the result of generations of trasmis- 
sion of ideas and customs incident to the environ- 
ment of the red men. 

FOUR MEN KILLED AT UINTAH SPRINGS, 
SANPETE COUNTY. 

On September 30th, 1853, a party of four men, 
William Reed, James Nelson, William Luke and 
Thomas Clark, started from Manti, Sanpete County, 
with ox teams loaded with wheat for Salt Lake City. 

It was arranged that they were to camp the first 
night on the Sanpitch River, near where Moroni is 
now located, and wait there until a company with 
horse teams under the leadership of Isaac Morley 
should overtake them ; then they were to travel slowly 
together through Salt Creek Canyon ; but contrary to 
arrangements they went on to Uintah Springs (now 
Fountain Green) and camped for the night. Early 
on the morning of October 1st their camp was at- 
tacked by Indians and all four men were killed. 

The savages had time in this instance to com- 
plete their fiendish work, mutilating the bodies of 
their victims to such a degree that when found they 
could scarcely be recognized. 

When Morley 's company came along they found 
three of the bodies of the murdered men, but the 
body of Clark had been covered up in the wagon 
with wheat that the Indians had emptied out of the 
sacks which they had taken away with them. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 75 

SKIRMISH AT NEPHI, JUAB COUNTY. 
EIGHT INDIANS KILLED. 

The company went oh to Nephi at the mouth of 
Salt Creek Canyon, and on the morning of the 2nd of 
October encountered a camp of Indians and had a 
skirmish, in which eight Indians were killed and 
one squaw and two boys taken prisoners. 

When they reported in Utah County, a possee 
of about twenty men from Springville, Spanish Fork 
and Payson was organized under command of James 
T. Guyman. They went to the Uintah Springs and 
found the remains of Thomas Clark under the wheat 
in the wagon. He had been scalped, his head crushed 
and his body cut open and his heart taken out. The 
posse went on to Manti and reported. They were 
accompanied by George Peacock from Springville 
who returned with the posse. At Manti they learned 
of the killing of William Mills and John Warner 
near Manti on the 4th. 

On their return the company stopped and buried 
the remains of Clark which was by then badly decom- 
posed. It was said that George Peacock, who was 
a relative of Clark, got the body and buried it at 
Manti. 

The particulars here given were obtained from 
Samuel T. Curtis of Salem, Utah County, who was 
one of the posse.

WM. MILLS AND JOHN E. WARNER 
KILLED AT MANTI, SANPETE COUNTY. 

On October 4, 1853, William Mills and John 
Warner were killed by Indians, near Manti. The 
following particulars are copied from a sketch writ- 
ten by Eunice Warner Snow, wife of John E. Warner 
one of the men killed at Manti, October 4th: 

"On the 4th of October, 1853, my husband was 
killed by the Indians in the edge of Manti Canyon 
while attending the grist mill. Mr. Warner, my hus- 
band, owned one third of the mill at the time he was 
killed, and it fell to his lot to attend the mill and 
grind the wheat for the people of Manti. The mill 
was situated about a mile from town. He had taken 
a number of men with him as a guard until the day 
he was killed. On that day it seemed there was no 
one who was willing to go with him. A man by the 
name of William Mills offered to go, as he needed 
some wood. He said he would take his oxen and 
cart and while Mr. Warner was grinding a grist, he 
would go into the mountains close to the mill and get 
some wood. Mr. Warner would not let him go out 
aJone, so they both went out a short distance from 
the mill, but before they went, my husband filled the 
hopper with wheat. He had taken his gun with him 
every day and had killed two rabbits the day before. 
I was cooking them for his supper when word came 
that he had been killed. We heard the report of the 
guns that killed the two men, but paid no attention 
to it as we had heard similar shooting before 
when my husband killed the two rabbits. 

The men were killed in the morning, as we 
thought. Soon after dinner a young man went up 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 77 

.to the mill for some flour. There was no one to to 
found around the mill, which was running at full 
speed, but had no wheat in the hopper. He knew 
something was wrong and came to town as fast as he 
could and told the condition in which he found the 
mill. They soon found a number of men to go in 
search of Warner and Mills and found their beuics 
a short distance from the mill. The cattle had albo 
been killed with poisoned arrows. The Indians had 
been in ambush waiting for an opportunity to do 
their work. Both men were stripped naked, except 
that my husband had his garments left on him. I 
was not allowed to see him as he was so badly disfig- 
ured in the face. The Indians, after they had tried 
to make peace with our people told that Mr. Warner 
had fought desperately and killed one Indian. 

Soon after the killing an Indian came to our 
house carrying my husband's gun, and one day two 
Indians came to our door, one of whom had my hus- 
band's neck tie on his black neck; the other had his 
pocket rule, which he always carried with him, and 
also his pen knife. This knife was a useful one, as 
it contained a number of articles, such as a button 
hook, an ear spoon, etc. Two or three articles they 
had broken up. _They were showing these things to 
my father and mother at the table as we happened to 
be eating dinner at the time. I grabbed a butcher 
knife which was lying on the table and started for 
them. My father seeing me rise from the table, 
caught me in his arms and carried me out of the 
room. It was more thar I could stand to see the 
black imps with my husband's things. This hap- 
pened a short time before the birth of my son, who 
was born six months after my husband was killed. 



78 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

Another serious trouble came of which I will 
joaake mention; Soon after my son was born, Chief 
Walker came to our house one day. He said he in- 
tended, when I got around again, to have me for his 
wife. He told my father and mother his intentions. 
They did not let me known anything about it until 
he came several times to see me ; when they told me 
it almost frightened me to death. I was obliged to 
keep in hiding from him for about six weeks, in fact

was dead. He died very suddenly/' 

ATTACK AT SANTAQUIN, UTAH COUNTY. 
FERNEE L. TINDRELL KILLED. 

On October 14, 1853, Indians attacked the infant 
settlement of Summit (now Santaquin), Utah Co., 
of which occurrence Albert Jones, of Provo, Utah 
County, wrote the following : 

The settlers of Santaquin had been driven from 
their homes, and had made their temporary residence 
at Payson, that being a more populous town and 
able by its numbers to defend itself against the In- 
dians who were then on the war-path under the 
lead of their chief Wah-ker. Crops had been planted 
at Santaquin that spring and a small party owning 
land there had come from Payson in the morning of 
Oct. 14, 1853 to harvest their potatoes. Among the 
number were Jonathan S. Page, Fernee L. Tindrel, 
Sybrannus Calkins, (a Mormon battalion boy) and 
John Sheffield, then a lad of about fifteen years. 
These harvesting parties came and returned to Pay- 
son the same day. 

On the morning of this day one of the boys go- 
ing over the hills with some companions espied a 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 79 

wolf and could not resist taking a shot at the brute, 
although that was contrary to orders in those days, 
as the firing of a gun was the signal agreed upon an- 
nouncing the approach of Indians. The older people 
were alarmed on the instant, but upon finding out 
the cause of the shot, reprimanded the boys and re- 
turned to their several patches of potatoes, working 
with a will to secure them for their winter's use. 

About 2 p. m. firing was heard again, but the men 
had grown careless, thinking it was the boys shoot- 
ing again. However, as the shooting continued, the 
parties became alarmed, and Jonathan S. Page and 
Sybranus Calkins, who were working together, 
looked up from their work and saw a number of In- 
dians in the distance firing at Furnee L. Tindrel and 
the boy John Sheffield. They saw Tindrel run quite 
a distance and then fall, but lost sight of the boy 
entirely. 

"The Indians, " said Captain Jonathan S. Page, 
who narrated this incident of the early Indian wars, 
"came straight on towards us, firing at us as they 
came. We prepared to take off a wagon box for 
breast works and fight them, but so many of them 
came in view through the oak brush and corn that we 
decided to leave and run to the main body of har- 
vesters. We had two yoke of oxen with us, one yoke 
chained to a wagon got so excited and sagged back 
on the chain, so that we could not unhook it. 

We started off driving a yoke of Calkin's cattle 
before us, but they were so heavy and moved so slow, 
that we abandoned them, and away we ran. The In- 
dian war-whoop was ringing in our ears, and the bul- 
lets whistling around us. I was young and a good 
runner, and with that horrid war-cry to urge me on, I 



80 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



cleared the three foot sage brush in our path like a 
deer. Calkins who had been exposed in his service in 
the battalion, could not keep near me and called 
out, "Page you ain't going to leave me?" 

I slackened speed until he came up. The bullets 
and arrows were whistling and screaming around us 
again. 

We renewed our pace, the Indians pressing close 
behind us, until we came to a thicket of large oak 
brush, into which we rushed for shelter ; the Indians 
soon approached above us on a ridge not a rag on 
them. Their red bodies shone and glistened in the 
sun. They must have been greased. They danced 
about the ridge, waving the scalp of poor Tindrel, 
and shouting their terrible war-cry. The thrilling 
effect is felt when imitated in our sham battle in the 
celebration of the twenty-fourth of July, but in the 
position we were in at the time, its terrifying effect 
had full force and our hair stood on end. As we 
dashed into the thickest oak brush we saw Abel But- 
terfield (a man noted for his great size and strength) 
on another ridge. We called to him that the Indians 
were upon him and that he had better run for safety. 
It seemed to daze him, as we looked out from our 
hiding places, we could see the old man (we always 
called him old) walking up and down on top of the 
slope opposite the Indians, waving his arms, and call- 
ing with his stentorian voice foj^the boys of Payson 
and the boys of Spring Creek to come on. This ruse, 
no doubt, had its effect, for the Indians did not ad- 
vance farther. 

They continued to cry to us to come out of the 
brush and attack them. They dared not come near 
us. I had a Kentucky rifle that carried a ball about 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 81 

as big as a pea, while Calkins had an old time Taylor 
rifle. After some time the Indians withdrew and 
went to the wagon and the cattle we had left. There 
were two other yoke of cattle there belonging to 
James Holman. The Indians shot and killed the 
oxen chained to the wagon and drove off the others 
with them. 

Luke Holman and Levi Colvin came up to the 
thicket where we had hid. There were now five of 
us, and we followed on after the Indians in hopes of 
getting the cattle back. The Indians saw us coming 
and divided their party, some continuing on with the 
cattle, while the rest made southward, toward San- 
taquin canyon. Here I found a good opportunity to 
count them, and made out thirty-nine. We thought 
they might have had horses at the mouth of the can- 
yon, and concluded we had better turn back for fear 
they would cut us off from the main body of harvest- 
ers. We then went back to the rest of the people, 
who numbered about nine. 

Levi Colvin had a pair of horses there, and 
Jonathan Davis mounted one of them and rode down 
to Payson to give the alarm ; soon about forty men in 
wagons and on horseback were hastening to our re- 
lief, in charge of Col. W. C. McClellan. 

Eobert E. Collet (later of Pleasant Grove) also 
ran into Payson on foot, following down the creek 
northward, and arrived there soon after the horse- 
men got in. 

Levi Colvin and myself, before the relief party 
came, went up through the brush and found the body 
of Tindrel ; he was scalped, and all his clothes were 
off, except his shirt. He was shot seven times. Two 
bullet holes and five arrows were found in his body. 



82 INDIAN DEPKBDATIONS 

The reason they had not taken off his shirt, was 
that one of his arms was pinned to his body with an 
arrow. One arrow had gone through the body, en- 
tering the back and protruding at the breast bone ; 
one bullet passed through him close to the heart, and 
he must have run seventy-five yards at least, after 
receiving this shot, before he fell. 

The horror that filled my soul at seeing the 
scalped and naked body of my friend, who but a few 
hours ago had been full of life, is indescribable. Shot 
down by cruel and relentless Indians, he laid there 
stripped, dead and mutilated, under the bright Oct- 
ober sun. We left him there, and returned to the po- 
sition occupied by the party of harvesters. 

The company from Payson under the command 
of Col. W. C. McClellan soon came on the ground. We 
took up the body of Brother Fernee L. Tindrel and 
sorrowfully wended our way back to Payson, where 
we interred his body in the cementery with military 
honors. I being one of the party that fired the salute 
above the grave. 

Young John Sheffield had hid in the brush and 
escaped unhurt. He came to us when he saw the ar- 
rival of the relief parties from Payson. 

The leading Indian of this party of marauders 
was a Ute known by the name of Showan, the brother 
of Santaquin, who lived in Thistle for many years 
and owned a ranch there and is now on the Indian 
reservation. Albert Jones. ' '

TREATY WITH CHIEF WALKER AND 

KANOSH. 
END OF UTE WAR. 

In May, 1854, after a "talk" with President 
Brigham Young, the Indian chief Walker (Surround- 
ed by his braves) and Kanosh, chief of the Pahvant 
Indians, entered into a formal treaty of peace at 
Chicken Creek, Juab County. This ended the Ute 
war, during which nineteen white persons and many 
Indians had been killed. 

During the war a number of the smaller settle- 
ments had been broken up, and their inhabitants 
moved to larger towns.

CHIEF WALKER DIED AT MEADOW 
CREEK, MILLARD COUNTY 

1855, January 29th. Walker, the Utah Chief, 
who had so long been a terror to the whites, died at 
Meadow Creek, in Millard County, and was succeed- 
ed by his brother Arapeen. Walker prior to his death, 
became convinced that the " Mormons " were his 
friends, and among his final words was an injunc- 
tion to his tribe to live at peace with the settlers and 
not molest them. 

According to the cruel custom then in vogue 
among the savages, an Indian boy and girl and thir- 
teen horses were buried alive with Walker, being 
secured near the corpse of the Chief at the bottom 
of a deep pit or walled enclosure, and left to suffer 
until death brought relief, It was said that two In- 
dians passed by the place, and the boy begged to be 
let out, but they passed on. The boy said that Wal- 
ker was beginning to stink. 

THE ELK MOUNTAIN MISSION, AND ABANDON- 
MENT. 

An Indian Mission known in the history of the 
Church as the Elk Mountain Mission was established 
for the purpose of educating a tribe of Indians who 
occupied the region of country in south-eastern Utah 
in the vicinity of the Elk Mountains (now the La 
Salle Mountains). Their main rendezvous was in a 
little Valley on the Grand River where the settlement 
of Moab is now situated. Those who went on this mis- 
sion were called at a general Conference of the 
Church held in Great Salt Lake City in April, 1855.

ings was appointed president of the mission by Presi- 
dent Brigham Young. The company after being 
partly organized for traveling, left Manti, Sanpete 
County, Monday May 21, 1855. It consisted of 41 
men, 15 wagons, 65 oxen, 16 cows, 13 horses, 2 bulls, 
1 calf, 2 pigs, 4 dogs, and 12 chickens, besides im- 
plements, seed grain, etc., and provisions. After a 
hard journey they arrived on Grand River on the 
evening on June llth. On the 12th they crossed tho 
river, came to some land that was cultivated "by In- 
dians who were friendly and wanted the white peo- 
ple to settle among them. By July they had built 
a stockade corral of logs, set three feet in the ground 
and six feet above, and had put in their grain, etc. 
and they started work on a stone fort. The fort 
was finished July 19th. 

One of the settlers writes : Sunday September 
22nd we changed herd-ground, feeling apprehensive 
of mischief intended by some Indians as they were 



86 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



very saucy and impudent. On inquiring why we 
had changed herd-ground, the boys began loading 
their guns, which caused the Indians to cool down, 
the Indians went off a short distance to consult to- 
gether. Soon three of them started for the field in the 
direction of the cattle, and in a few minutes James 
W. Hunt started with a lariat to get lois horse. Char- 
les, a son of Suit-Sub-Soc-Its or St. John, followed 
him on horse-back ; he kept telling him to go ahead of 
him, asking what he was afraid of, Hunt kept turn- 
ing his head occasionally towards him, as though 
being apprehensive of danger, they got nearly a 
mile from the fort when Charles told him to look at 
the stock. He did so, raising himself on tip-toe. 
That instant Charles shot him, then shouted to an- 
other Indian, not far off, to run and take the horses. 
The ball entered Hunt's back, ranging downward 
about one and a half inches from the back bone, on 
the left side, and four inches from the small of the 
back. This happened about half past twelve o 'clock. 
Ephraim Wight and Sheldon B. Cutler were herding 
the stock. The Indians left and went across the 
river, Cutler came to the fort on horse-back and 
told what had happened. President Billings jumped 
on behind him. Peter Stubbs followed, and while 
John Clark and another followed with water and re- 
turned to the fort, Clinton Williams started on 
horse back after the stock. The boys carried Hunt 
in a blanket; but before they got within one fourth 
of a mile of the fort, the Indians re-crossed the river 
and came charging towards the boys and stock, rais- 
ing a war whoop. Wm. M. Sterrett, Sheldon B. Cut- 
ler and Clark A. Huntington acted as rear guard to 
the boys who were carrying Hunt and fired upon 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 87 

the Indians who had fired some eight or ten guns be- 
fore our boys commenced shooting. President Bill- 
ings was wounded by a ball passing through the 
fore finger of his right hand. The bullets whistled 
briskly all around. The men arrived safely with 
the wounded man and the horses and cattle were 
taken inside the corral, except those the Indians had 
driven off. Every man was engaged. Soon one of 
the Indians set fire to our hay stacks which were ad- 
joining the north end of the corral ; they were entire- 
ly consumed, as also the corn, and it took five or six 
men steady to carry water to save the corral logs, so 
as to keep what stock we had on the inside. The 
firing was kept up by the Indians till after dark. We 
succeeded in saving the corral, although some of the 
logs were nearly consumed. Seven Indians were seen 
to leave, Charles at their head, going to the moun- 
tains. The day previous (Saturday) two of the boys, 
Edward Edwards and William Behunin went hunt- 
ing, expecting to return Sunday afternoon, Captain 
Capsium, a Tampa Ute, came down to the corner of 
the fort and corral and talked to Clark A. Hunting- 
ton for some time when a few more Indians came. 
They said we had killed two or three of them and 
wounded as many, and they would not be satisfied 
till they had killed two more " Mormons. " They at 
first denied having killed the two boys who were out 
hunting and wanted bread. We gave them all we 
had. The Indians had turned the water off from us, 
They finally acknowledged killing the two boys out 
hunting. Hunt expired the following day. 

Early in the morning of Monday, Sept. 24th the 
Indians came to the fort and said they were glad 
that three Mormons had been killed ; they had killed 



8 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 



the two boys as they were coming down the moun- 
tain. Thus three of our boys were killed. Three In- 
dians had also been killed and three others wounded 
who would die. It was now thought best to move out 
right away, or we should all die, as the Indians had 
sent runners out into the mountains for help. We 
packed up and without breakfast left about eleven 
o 'clock in the morning, leaving fifteen head of horses 
twenty-four head of cattle with a calf, besides six 
head which we gave the Indians. When we got to 
the north side of Grand river, a brother of St. John 
and uncle to Charles, the leader, came to us. Clark 
A. Huntington told him all that had taken place, 
and what we had left behind. He said it was too 
bad, but he was only one against many. He said 
we should have our cattle, and he would see that the 
bodies of the boys who had been killed were taken 
<jare of and buried. Together with his sons he went 
to the fort and talked to the Indians. He had some 
difficulty with them, when they began shooting the 
cattle. The friendly Indians who succeeded in driv- 
ing away fifteen head of cattle, delivered to us eight 
cows and kept seven that were wounded. They 
butchered three head and brought us a little of the 
meat. 

We arrived in Manti, Sunday Sept. 30th, be- 
tween 4 and 5 o'clock p. m. John McEwan who was 
left behind the last morning driving his pony which 
was tired, some three miles from where we started, 
got bewildered and lost his way. The trail being dim 
and not very easy to follow, left all he had except 
his gun, and traveled eating nothing from Saturday 
night the 27 till Wednesday forenoon the 3rd 
of October about eleven o'clock a. m. when he was 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



met by three men, viz: Nathaniel Beach, John 
Lowry, jr. both of Manti and Lyman A. Woods of 
Provo, and two Indians belonging to Arrapeen's 
band who left Manti on Tuesday night at half past 
ten o 'clock in pursuit of him. They arrived at Manti 
Thursday morning 7 :30 o 'clock. 

THE SALMON RIVER MISSION. 

On May 19, 1855, a company was organized on 
the west side of Bear Biver, Utah, for the purpose 
of colonizing the Great Northwest. The company 
consisted of twenty-seven men with thirteen wagons, 
twenty-six yoke of cattle, a few cows and implements 
of industry. The personel of the company was : 

Thomas S. Smith, Farmington, Davis County, 
Utah ; Ezra J. Barnard, Farmington, Davis County, 
Utah; Isaac Shepherd, Farmington, Davis County, 
Utah; Baldwin H. Watts, South Weber, Utah; 
Geo. R. Grant, Kaysville, Davis County, Utah; 
Charles Dalton, Centerville, Davis County, Utah; 
Israel J. Clark, Centerville, Davis County, Utah; 
Wm. H. Batchelor, Salt Lake City, Utah ; Ira Ames, 
Salt Lake City, Utah; William Bunbridge, Salt 
Lake City, Utah; Thomas Butterfield, West Jor- 
dan, Salt Lake County, Utah; William Surges, 
Provo, Utah; Abraham Zundel, Willard, Box 
Elder, Utah; Everett Lish, Willard, Box Elder, 
Utah; Francillo Durfee, Ogden, Utah; David 
Moore, Ogden, Utah; Benjamin F. Cummings, 
Ogden, Utah; Gilbert E. Belknap; Ogden, Utah; 
Joseph Parry, Ogden, Utah ; Nathaniel Leavitt, 
Ogden, Utah ; Pleasant Green Taylor, Ogden, Utah ; 
Charles McGeary, Ogden, Utah; John Gallagher* 



90 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

Ogden, Utah; John W. Browning, Ogden, Utah; 
David H. Stevens, Ogden, Utah; William Birch, 
Ogden, Utah; Geo. Hill, Ogden, Utah. 
The following officers were elected : 
Thomas S. Smith, President; Francillo Durfee, 
Captain' 1 David Moore, Secretary; B. F. Cummings, 
Captain of the guard. 

Thus organized, on the 20th day of May, tho 
company commenced their journey. They traveled 
up Malad valley and crossed the Bannock divide, 
then they went down Bannock Creek, crossed Port- 
neuf River, and Ross' Fork and Blackfoot River, 
thence until they reached Snake River, which they 
crossed at a point five miles above Fort Hall and 
near Ross 7 Butte, and traveled on the west side of 
the river until they reached a point three miles above 
Eagle Rock. On leaving Snake River they passed 
Market Lake on the north and camped on Muddy 
Lake. Leaving Muddy Lake the company traveled 
thirty miles across a desert when they reach- 
ed Spring Creek, (Birch Creek). Traveling 
northward they followed little Lost River sixty miles 
until they arrived at the top of Salmon range of 
mountains. They journeyed down this creek called 
Salmon River (now Limhi), until they reached a 
point twenty miles above where it empties into Sal- 
mon River. They arrived at this point June 15th, 
which was three hundred and thirty- three miles from 
Ogden, according to the odometer constructed by 
Col. David Moore. Here they built a stockade fort 
and named it "Fort Limhi. " It was about twenty 
rods square. The wall was built of logs sixteen feet 
long, standing on end close together. It had one 
gate on the east side and one on the west. They built 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 91 



their houses of logs, on one side of the fort. Bas- 
tions were built at each corner of the fort. 

The country through which they traveled was a 
dreary waste, very forbidding, and covered thick 
ly with wild sage, and at that time was but little 
known to white people. It was eastern Oregon, (now 
in Idaho.) 

On their arrival they found a large number of 
Indians consisting of Bannocks, Sho-shones and Nez- 
Perses, who were on their annual fishing trip. 
Through their interpreter, Geo. W. Hill, the Indians 
were made to understand that the colony had come 
there to settle, that they were their friends, that they 
were there to help them, to teach them how to till 
the ground, how to build houses and live like white 
people. The Indians gave the colonists a friendly 
welcome. 

In the afternoon of the same day on which they 
arrived, the colony commenced to build their irri- 
ation canal. David Moore and B. F. Cummings, 
surveyed the ditch with a bottle filled with water 
for a level and steel square for a straight edge. A 
part of the company commenced work on the water 
ditch, while others were engaged in herding cattle 
The water for irrigation was brought from a creek 
on the east side of the valley, about forty rods above 
the fort, where the dam was built, to flood the land 
before it could be ploughed. 

About the 22nd of June the colony planted peas, 
potatoes, turnips, etc. This was the first irrigation 
that was done in the Great Northwest. Bancroft 
gives this credit to these first settlers. The crops 
of the first year were a failure, being destroyed by 
heavy frost on the night of the 4th of September. 



92 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

The same year the grasshoppers appeared in count- 
less numbers and deposited their eggs. 

There being no saw mill, the lumber for the 
windows, doors, and floors, was manufactured with 
a -whip-saw. Every day and night a strong guard 
was placed over the cattle ; and men were forced to 
go heavily armed. 

Prior to the loss of the crops it was discovered 
that the supplies on hand would run out and the seed 
remaining would be insufficient for next year's sow- 
ing. So, early in August, about one half of the col- 
ony returned to Utah for supplies and to carry the 
mail. They returned on the 19th of November, 1855, 
bringing the mail from Utah. Some of them also 
brought their families. Francillo Durfree brought 
his wife and daughter; C. M. McGeary, his wife; I 
J. Clark, his wife and three children. These women 
and children were the first white females to settle 
in the Great Northwest. Louisa, daughter of Col. 
G. Moore subsequently became the wife of Lewis 
W. Shurtliff, who is now a member of Congress. 

(This marriage took place January 4th, 1858, 
being the first white couple married in this north 
country.) 

About the first of August, Lewis W. Shurtliff 
and John Leavitt started from Salt Lake with mail 
and supplies. 

By the first of December, 1855, President Smith, 
ascertained that their food supplies would be ex- 
hausted before the first of March, 1856. He called 
for volunteers to go to Utah for supplies and also to 
carry mail. The following eight responded: viz: 
George W. Hill, Joseph Parry, Abraham Zundel, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 93 



Wm. Burch, Isaac Shepherd, Thomas Butterfield 
and William Batchelor. 

They left fort Limhi on the 4th of December with 
an outfit consisting of eight men, six yoke of oxen 
and three wagons ; one wagon they were compelled 
to leave by the wayside. They arrived in Ogden on 
December 26th in good health, but "Mighty hungry" 
and suffering more or less from frost bites. 

On March 28th, 1856, they left Ogden on their 
return to Limhi with the mail from Utah and their 
supplies, bringing with them the following new 
colonists : 

Alexander Hill, John Freece, Sylvanus Collett, 
Thomas Abbot, Wai. Mclntyre, William Perkins, 
Thos. Carlos, Thos. Day, Clifton, S. Browning, Jos. 
Harker, Jacob Miller, Geo. McBride, H. A. Cleveland, 
Thomas Bingham, William Shaw, John Murdock, 
Pardon Webb, James Walker, R. B. Margetts, Henry 
Nebeker, William B. Lake, Hathron C. Hadlock. 
The party reached Fort Limhi May 15th, 1856, in 
charge of Joseph Parry. During the summer '56 
Messrs. Moore, Cummings and Parry commenced the 
erection of a grist mill ; Mr. Burges having brought 
the mill stones with him from Utah and Mr. Moore 
brought the mill irons. The mill was completed in 
1859. In 1856 the colony commenced to build an- 
other irrigation ditch, which they finished in 1857. 
and it is still in operation by Mr. J. B. Sharkey. 

An addition was made to the colony by the ar- 
rival of M. D. Hammond, H. V. Shurtliff , E. Robin- 
son and Owen Dix who brought the mail from Utah. 
They came during the summer of 1856. In August 
L. W. Shurtliff and Nathaniel Leavitt carried the 
mail from Limhi to Utah, and had a narrow escape 



94 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

from death by Indians, near where Bailey Lake was 
subsequently shot and killed. During this summer 
Lot Smith and John Clawson arrived from Utah with 
the mail, and returned with the mail from Limhi to 
Utah. 

Early in the spring of 1856, the colony sowed a 
large acreage of wheat which gave promise of an 
abundant harvest ; but the grasshoppers hatched out 
in myriads and destroyed the fruits of their toil and 
blighted their hopes for this year. Before them was 
indeed a fruitful field, but when they left, behind 
them was a desolation. The land was cleaned of 
every vestige of vegetation. This forced the colony 
for the third time to resort to Utah for fresh sup- 
plies of provisions and for seed grain for the en- 
suing year. 

David Moore, Pleasant G. Taylor and others 
were sent with the mail to Utah and to bring back 
supplies. At the commencement of winter, Hill, 
Parry and Lychonius Barnard were also sent with 
the mail from Limhi. The two companies returned 
with the mail and supplies for the colony, May, 1857. 
(It should have been stated in the summer of 1856, a 
body of troops, fifty or more arrived at the colony 
in search of Indians who had commited depredations 
on white settlers in Oregon. They stayed about one 
week and then left. 

In May, 1857, the colony had a pleasant visit 
from President Brigham Young and a large company 
of others, including Heber C. Kimball, Gen. Daniel 
H. Wells and prominent citizens of Utah. They ex- 
pressed themselves much pleased with the colony and 
the President said he would send them more aid to 
strengthen the colony. He advised them to build a 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 95 

llllllllllllllllllllllltlMMIIIMIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIl 

Spanish wall for their better protection, which they 
did at the south end of the fort. The wall is still 
standing. This same year, they raised about 2,000 
bushels of wheat besides other grain and vegetables. 
This was the first grain raised in Idaho by irriga- 
tion. 

In fulfillment of this promise the President sent 
the following persons to strengthen the settlers at 
Limhi: John L. Dalton, James Wilcox, Jane Had-

Bowen, Steven Cheen and wife, Henry Harman and 
wife, and James McBride. They arrived at Fort 
Limhi Oct. 27th, 1857. 

Arrangements were at once made for building a 
new fort about two miles below Limhi, thereby in- 
creasing the acreage and strength of the colony, and 
also giving more room for new arrivals. A num- 
ber of log houses were erected on the plan of those 
of the upper fort. Milton Harmon was appointed 
to preside over this little community. Everything 
went along peacefully and all were taking hold of 
needed work, to prepare for winter. 

November 28th, President Smith and L. W. 
Shurtliff started with the mail for Salt Lake City, 
but were compelled to return, arriving on the llth 
of December, and reported that the snow Tsas too 
deep and they found it impractical to cross the moun- 
tains.

The threshing of the wheat (which was done 
by oxen) and the cleaning occupied all winter. The 
cleaning was done by a fanning mill, which was con- 
structed by David Moore and others at the fort. 

Feb. 28th, 1858, Col. Smith saw the Indians in a 
hostile attitude; he saddled his horse and called on 
the men to follow him, and then started to head off 
the cattle which the red skins were stealing. Many 
of the men started to follow him, but Col. Moore, 
fearing that the fort would be left exposed to the 
foes, organized a company of ten to follow Col. Smith 
and detained the rest to defend the fort. The In- 
dians fired on all of the colonists. Geo. McBride and 
James Miller were killed, and Col. Smith and four 
others were wounded. Col. Moore detailed men to 
bring in the dead and wounded. The foresight of 
David Moore saved the fort, for it was discovered 
afterwards that the Indians expected that the col- 
onists would pursue them, when, having some of 
their tribe in ambush, they would take possession, 
kill the men and carry off the women and children. 

An express was sent by B. H. Watts and Ezra 
Barnard to President Young, informing him of what 
had occurred. He immediately sent out one hun- 
dred and fifty mounted men and twenty wagons with 
provisions, under the command of Col. Cunning- 
ham, to relieve the colony and escort them to Utah. 

The fort was vacated March 28th, 1858. The 
men were sent forward as a van guard. The Indians 
followed them two hundred miles. They waylaid 
them. They killed, stripped and scalped Bailey 
Lake. When the colony left the fort snow was on 
the ground in many places, and the men had to help 
the teams with lariats. On April llth, 1858, at 3

o'clock p. m. they arrived in Ogden. Before leav- 
ing Limhi the colony cached their wheat, about two 
thousand bushels, in different places. 

This ended the first mission to colonize the 
great Northwest to introduce the system of irriga- 
tion and endeavor to civilize the aborigines, after 
two years and nine months most incessant labor, toil 
and sacrifices. It cost three lives of colonists, and 
five others were wounded. It also cost them hun- 
dreds of thousands of dollars in time, horses, cattle, 
crops and other property. 

THE SALMON RIVER MISSION ABANDONED. 

Since the fort was vacated the land fell into 
other hands, and a government reservation was es- 
tablished a little distance above this point, and now 
appears on the maps as "Fort Limhi " and "Limhi 
Valley Indian Reservation." 

The names of Crandle Dunn and Amos Wright 
of Box Elder Co., and James Hill of Mill Creek, Salt 
Lake County, have been inadvertently omitted from 
the body of this report. They should be in as 
they were in the Salmon Eiver Mission. 

ANOTHER ACCOUNT. 

An account of an expedition that was sent out 
from Utah by Governor Young to relieve a colony 
of settlers that had located on Salmon River, Ore- 
gon: 

In 1855 President Brigham Young and the lead- 
ers of the Church called a company of men with their 
families to go North into Oregon and explore the 
country and establish a settlement to open up the 
country for other settlers. This company crossed the 
mountains to Snake river and followed the river up 



98 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

to Market Lake. From here they turned Northwest 
onto the head waters of the Salmon river and built 
a fort which was named Fort Limhi from which Lim- 
hi County, Idaho, was afterwards named. This col- 
ony got along alright until the winter of 1857 and 
spring of 1858, when through the influence of one 
John Powel, a mountaineer who was very bitter 
against the Mormons, the Indians made a raid on 
the colony. A battle was fought and the colonists 
lost all their stock, except some animals they were 
using at the time. Two men were killed and four 
others wounded. The names of those killed were 
George McBride and James T. Miller of Farmington 
Davis County, Utah. Those wounded were Thomas 
S. Smith, the Captain of the company, O. L. Robin- 
son, Andrew Quigley and Fountain Welch all of 
Farmington. The last mentioned never fully recov- 
ered from their wounds. 

This left the colony in a helpless condition, and 
over four hundred miles from any assistance. After 
some consideration they saw there was only one 
chance for them to get help, and that was for some 
one or two persons to risk their lives and go out by 
night and attempt to get by the Indians. George W. 
Hill and Baldwin Watts undertook this task. After 
three weeks travel and suffering from hunger and 
cold they got through to Salt Lake City and reported 
the condition of the colony to Governor Young, who 
immediately called out three companies of the Utah 
militia consisting of fifty men in each company. One 
company being from Davis County with Horton D. 
Kaight as captain, one company from Weber County 
and the other from Lehi, Utah County, Abram 
Hatch, Captain. Colonel Cunningham of Salt Lake 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 99 



County was placed in command. 

We were called out on the fourth of March, 
1858, and started on the 10th. Some of the men were 
poorly clad and suffered with the cold. Every man 
had to furnish himself, except what neighbors were 
pleased to donate to help him. We reached the fort 
on March 27th, seventeen days after starting and 
found the colonists alright. 

The commanding officer concluded to send an 
express of ten men on the return to report the con- 
dition of things, which was opposed by all the othei 
officers, but he was obdurate and would not yield. 
The men were selected and I was one of the party. 
We started on the 29th of March. When we got to 
Market Lake, we met a party of Indians who had the 
horse that George McBride was riding when he wa^ 
killed. The boys seemed determined to get this horse 
and after some dickering they succeeded, but the In- 
dians seemed quite sulky. Just as we were ready to 
start someone told the captain that they had seen a 
cowhide close to the Indian camp. The captain fool- 
ishly accused the Indians of stealing cattle which 
made the chief angry and he raised his spear and 
would have killed the captain, had not Brother Watts 
raised his gun in his face, shouted at him which made 
him drop his spear. The chief gave a war-whoop 
and in a few seconds we were entirely surrounded 
by the Indians and it looked as though we would all 
be killed on the spot, but brother Watts talked to 
them in their own language for about ten minutes. 
Finally he went up to the captain and gave him a 
push and called him a squaw. This saved our lives 
for they turned away and left us. This was on the 
first of April. Again on the 4th of April, the Indians 



100 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



ambushed us in Bannock Canyon about thirty miles 
southwest of where Pocatello now stands. We fought 
them from two o'clock p. m. until after sun down 
when they pulled off and left us. We had one man 
killed Bailey Lake of Ogden three saddle horses 
shot and we lost all our pack animals with our sup- 
plies and one extra horse, nineteen head in all. 
Our loss was not less than $1,500.00. We were one 
hundred miles from any settlement and two men were 
without horses to ride. We traveled this distance in 
forty-eight hours without food or rest. 

The names of those in this party were Franklin 
Cummings, George W. Hill, Baldwin H. Watts, Bai- 
ley Lake, who was killed, Thomas Bingham, George 
Barber, Thomas Blocksom, John B. Blanchard, J. 
T. Workman and one other whose name I have for- 
gotten. 

The last of the company arrived on April 20th 
and we were honorably discharged after having been 
out forty days.

THE TINTIC WAR. 

In the year 1856, the Indians, a part of the Utes, 
again beeaone hostile, and a sufficient number of 
them went on the war path to make it expensive, 
and annoying to the settlers. The Indians were 
stealing cattle and horses in Utah and Cedar Valleys 
and a sub-chief of the Utes named Tintic was the 
ring-leader of the hostiles, some of whom dwelt in a 
valley subsequently called Tintic, and others in Ce- 
dar Valley; both of these valleys lies west of Utah 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 101 

Lake. The Indians killed two herdsmen, Henry 
Moren and Washington Carson, Feb. 21, 1856. When 
these two men did not return when expected 
a search was instituted by the citizens. 

A POSSE WENT IN PURSUIT OF CHIEF 
TINTIC AND BAND. 

Deputy Marshal Thomas S. Johnson came to 
Provo and enlisted a posse of about ten men who, 
armed with writs of arrest, issued by Judge Drum- 
mond, in Utah County, set out for Cedar Valley to 
apprehend the murderers. The posse started from 
Provo and went by way of Lehi where they camped 
the first night. Colonel Conover accompanied the 
posse as far as Lehi, at which point he left for Salt 
Lake City to seek advice from Governor Brigham 
Young who at that time was also superintendent of 
Indian affairs. The posse proceeded into Cedar 
Valley, and while Johnson with part of the men 
went to the north settlement, ten men were detached 
to go to the south fort, afterwards known as Camp 
Floyd. One division of the posse was under com- 
mand of Deputy Marshal George Parish. The posse 
stayed at Cedar Fort during the night, and on the 
following morning sent interpreter John Clark to 
the Indian camp, about a mile southwest of the fort 
to talk to Chief Tintic and his followers. He went 
to the chief's tent, where several Indians were pres- 
ent. Tintic treated the matter with contempt, and 
spoke vilely of President Young. The Indians were 
talking of keeping Clark there until dark, and when 
he should start away, they would kill him. He 
(Clark) understood them; he had on an overcoat and 



102 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



carried two revolvers under it on his belt. He had 
walked to the camp, and as he was fast on foot (being 
considerable of an athlete) he intended on leaving to 
dodge round as he ran. Thus, if they fired at him, 
they would not be likely to hit him, so he said after- 
wards. 

While talking, a squaw on the outside called out, 
1 1 Mommons coming. ' ' The Indians, while in conver- 
sation, had stripped and painted in their war-paints, 
and prepared for fight; they had their spears set 
up against the tent handy to get at. When the com- 
pany came up, Deputy Sheriff Parish got off his 
horse and came into the tent, walked up to Tintic, 
caught him by the hair with one hand, and with re- 
volver in the other said: "Tintic, you are my pris- 
oner. ' ' Tintic grabbed the pistol with one hand and 
jumped, the pistol went off and shot him through 
the hand ; he broke loose and went through the back 
of the tent ; then firing commenced. Tintic 's brother 
Battest aimed his rifle at George Parish and fired, 
but the gun -barrel being knocked aside the bullet 
missed its mark. One of Parish's friends then drew 
his revolver and shot Battest through the head, kill- 
ing him instantly. A general fight followed in 
which one of the posse, George Carson was mortal- 
ly wounded, one squaw and three or four Indians 
were also killed and several wounded. At this junc- 
ture, John Clark, the interpreter, ran back into the 
tent and got two guns and four or five bows and 
quivers of arrows, ran out, untied Tintic 's and his 
brother's horses, jumped onto Tintic 's horse arid 
led the other. He laid down on the horse as he rode 
away, with bullets whistling by him, but escaped 
without injury. All went back to the fort. A mes- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 103 



senger was sent to notify Deputy Marshal Tom 
Johnson who came immediately with the remainder 
of the posse. That night the Indians killed two 
boys, by the name of Henry Moran and William 
Carson who were herding sheep on the west side of 
Utah Lake. The next morning the posse foUowed 
the trail of the Indians who left during the ni&l-t, 
and found them camped on the side of a mountain 
in the cedars on the east side of Bush Valley. A 
parley was held, but the Indians refused to sur- 
render and fired upon the posse. It being late in the 
evening the Deputy Marshal deemed it wise to re- 
turn to the fort with the intention to pursue the next 
day ; but in the morning they found the Indian camp 
broken up and the Indians going in a direction where 
they would be overtaken by Colonel Conover 's com- 
pany, the posse gave up the pursuit, turned attention 
to the security of the settlements, and in searching 
for the other two, Moran and Carson and young Hun- 
saker, a thirteen year old boy whom the Indians 
had also killed; they found them where the Indians 
had killed them. Meantime, Governor Young had 
given orders to Colonel Peter W. Conover to raise a 
company of the Utah County Militia, pursue the In- 
dians and recover the Hunsaker herd of stock which 
had been driven off after killing the herds-men. Ac- 
cordingly, Col. Conover, with eighty men pursued, 
crossed the Utah lake on ice, and took the trail of the 
Indians where they crossed the mountains. 

The company pursued all day and camped in 
Tintic Valley, just out of the mouth of a canyon. On 
the second day the pursuing party came so close 
upon the Indians in the lower end of Tintic Valley 
that they took fright and left the stock behind ex- 



104 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

cept a few saddle horses ; and the expedition return- 
ed with the stock. 

Bishop Nephi Packard, to whom we are indebted 
for some of this information says " While at the 
fort, the citizens brought in the bodies of Moran and 
Carson, frozen stiff. Their bodies had been mutila- 
ted, and when they were thawed out with warm water 
for the purpose of dressing them, it created a stench 
which together with the sight of their mutilated 
bodies, made him sick. They were buried there." 

FROM TULLIDGE'S HISTORY, VOL. 3, PAGE 157. 
By John Banks. 

John Banks of Spanish Fork, one of the found- 
ers of that place communicated the following addi- 
tional details confirming the Tintic War, which 
was supplied in Tullidge's History, Vol. 3, p. 157. 

In February 1856, T. S. Johnson, a U. S. Deputy 
Marshal, came to Palmyra in pursuit of Indians 
who had been committing depredations on the whites, 
expecting that he would find some of them with 
Peteetneet 's band, but failed. He then received word 
by express that the Indians had killed two of the 
Hunsaker's herds-men, on the west side of Utah 
lake, and that a herd-boy was missing who was sup- 
posed to be killed also, for the Indians had taken the 
whole herd of cattle. Peteetneet, the chief of the 
Indians on the Spanish Fork, being friendly dis- 
posed was consulted. Peteetneet was grieved at the 
hostilities of Tintic and his band, and remarked that 
Tintic had ears that were no good and of no use to 
him. He had good council given him, but he would 
not hear it, and (Peteetneet) wanted Peanitch, the 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 105 

Indian guide, and three others, when they would find 
Tintic, to cut off his ears, as they were of no good. 
This talk took place just before the Marshal, with 
about seventy-five men left Palmyra for the west 
mountains. i ' This was a very exciting time, ' ' writes 
John Banks. "We camped the first night on the 
north end of the so-called west mountain, where we 
experienced an extremely cold night, without any 
bedding except our saddle blankets, and were not 
allowed to have any fire after sundown. When day 
dawned we learned that several of our men had 
frozen feet, and consequently had to return home. 
Among those with frozen feet was William Fair- 
banks of Payson, but he would not return home. 
Early in the morning we saddled our horses, and 
the order, "mount, forward march/' was gvien. 
Fairbanks would continue the march, nothwithstand- 
ing he suffered much during the expedition. We had 
not gone far before we struck the trail of an Indian, 
which track we followed on the ice across the Utah 
Lake, till we came to the dugout where Hunsaker's 
two herdsmen had been killed in the cedars. The 
blood was lickered in the sand, the sight of which 
caused quite a sensation. Orders were given to 
scout. Scouters returned with an ox, which was soon 
killed, and a time of general sharpening of sticks 
to roast beef for dinner took place. Meanwhile, 
the officers consulted each others as to the best 
course to pursue, and decided that the men be divi- 
ded into tens to examine the most likely places for 
Indians or to ascertain which way they had gone. 
This was soon found out, and when the signal was 
given that the trail had been discovered, the whole 
company marched up the canyon, leading to what is 



106 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

now called Tintic Valley. The name of the place 
originated with this expedition, said valley being 
until that time unexplored by white men. We learn- 
ed that the Indians had taken a southwesterly di- 
rection and as we journeyed on we had to encounter 
deep snow and exceedingly cold weather. Frequent- 
ly we saw cattle standing up, braced in the snow, 
frozen quite stiff. In this locality we expected to get 
our supply of food on our return provided we did not 
overtake the Indians. We pushed forward as fast as 
we could, and as we came on their camping places we 
could learn how fast we were gaining ground on 
them. We made three of their days travel in one 
day. The third day we saw their camp fire smoke, 
but we did not like the location, as it seemed like we 
were marching right into the fortification of the 
savages. Passing a heavy body of cedars, we found 
ourselves on the edge of the great desert, where we 
were pleased to discover some stock and we picked 
out the best beef from seventy-five head, having had 
nothing to eat that morning. Our Indian guide 
informing us that it was about six miles to the Sevier 
River, orders were given to march thither to water 
our stock. There was no trail to follow the Indians 
having scattered in every direction. Our horses had 
been without water since we left the Utah Lake. We 
camped on Sevier river that night. Early next 
morning we found thirty head of horses, but no In- 
dians. We then traveled up the river in a northeast- 
erly direction and came out at Nephi. The inhabi- 
tants rallied to a point on the north side of the herd 
to save the cattle. There being a raise of land in- 
tervening between us, the one party could not see the 
other for a little while. The next time they saw us 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 107 

the supposed Indians were making for the settle- 
ment, and would take the town ere any of the citizens 
could get back. It was a time of general rejoice- 
ing with the Nephites when they found the supposed 
Lamanites were their friends ; and, on the other 
hand, we rejoiced on being well treated, and having 
plenty of good food to eat, having had nothing to 
eat for seven days previous except fresh beef, with- 
out salt. weary and tired, we appreciated the com- 
fortable beds and happy rest afforded us that night. 
Next morning we, with grateful hearts, shook hands 
with our Nephi friends, started for home, and great 
was our mutual joy. 

Deseret News of March 5th, 1856, published the 
following : 

' ' Tintic, head chief of the disaffected band, and 
who was wounded in the skirmish near the south fort 
in Cedar Valley, is reported dead. ' ' 

FOUR PERSONS MASSACRED IN 
SALT CREEK CANYON. 

June 4th. Jens Jorgensen and wife, Jens Ter- 
klesen and Christian E. Kjerluf were massacred by 
Indians in Salt Creek Canyon, June 4th, 1858 while 
traveling unarmed on their way to Sanpete Valley. 
They had camped at the head waters in the canyon. 
After traveling about a mile after dinner, and having 
reached a point about a mile and a half from the 
head of the canyon, some Indians came from their 
hiding place and attacked them; two of the men 
were killed in the wagon, and burned with it. One 
man was killed about fifty yards from the wagon, 
and the woman was found dead close by the wagon, 



108 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

making four killed. John Ericksen, the only one 
who escaped, made his way to Ephraim where he ar- 
rived about dark. An ox hitched onto a hand-cart, 
and driven by one of the men, got frightened, and 
ran back to Nephi. 

The bodies were brought to Ephraim for burial. 
These people were on their way to Ephraim where 
they intended to settle. 

(Most of this information was obtained from 
N. 0. Anderson of Glenwood Utah.) 

THE BODIES OF JOSIAH CALL AND SAMUEL 

BROWN FOUND MURDERED AT CHICKEN 

CREEK, JUAB COUNTY. 

On October 15th, 1858. The remains of Josiah 
Call and Samuel Brown, of Fillmore, Millard County, 
were found in a state of decomposition near Chicken 
Creek bridge, Juab County. They had been mur- 
dered by Indians on October 7th. 

The following details of the murder are culled 
from the Deseret News of Nov. 3, 1858 : 

On Friday last some fifteen men started again to 
renew the search, they met Brother Shepherd at 
Cedar Springs, who had just come in from the north. 
He told them that he saw a dead body about two 
miles south of Chicken Creek ; accordingly they pro- 
ceeded forthwith to the place and found both bodies 
within about two hundred yards of each other. 
Brother Brown was shot through the heart, scalped, 
and his throat cut. Birds had eaten the flesh from 
Brother Call's bones, with the exception of the left 
leg below the knee and his left arm; but it was 
evident he had been shot three times ; once through 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 109 

the right breast, the ball lodging in the back bone; 
once through the left ankle and once through the 
head, the ball entering the back part of the skull near 
the seam and coming out at the left side of the nose. 
It is supposed his throat was also cut, as the blood 
had run from where his neck lay and his right arm 
was entirely gone and was not be found. They were 
both stripped of all their clothing except their un- 
der clothes, shoes and stockings. The remains were 
this day interred in the cemetery of this place, the 
occasion being one the most solemn I ever witnes- 
sed. 

MURDER OF A PEACEABLE INDIAN BY OFFICERS 
FROM CAMP FLOYD. 

Fillmore City, Apr. 10th, 1860. 
From Deseret News : 

Yesterday I heard of the most outragous mur- 
der that has come to my knowledge for some time. 
When the company returned from the Colorado they 
brought an Indian with them who has been living 
at Cedar Springs with -David Savage ever since. 
Some few days since, an Officer by the name of Kirk, 
in company with one Johnston, came to the Springs 
with a writ for the Indian, whose name was John 
The officer served the writ by arresting the Indian, 
and then started with him immediately for Camp 
Floyd. Shortly afterwards a rumor reached our 
City to the effect that the Indian had been murdered 
on the Sevier near the bridge, and thrown into the 
river. Bishop Brunson and some others saddled 
their horses and rode to the place designated to 
a scertain the truth of the report ; they made search 
and found the body in the river, a short distance

below the place described. On taking the body from 
the water, they found it had been pierced with four 
bullets, two passing through near the heart. The 
savage custom of scalping had also been performed 
upon the Indian. Such laurels are easier won than 
worn. 

March 22nd, I860. The Overland Mail Coach 
with four passengers was attacked by Indians near 
Eight Mile Station, Tooele County. Henry Harper, 
the driver, was killed and one passenger wounded. 
Judge Mott, Delegate to Congress from Nevada, 
who was in the coach took the reins, drove for his 
life and escaped. 

MAIL STATION AT DEEP CEEEK AT- 
TACKED, ONE MAN SHOT. 

May 28th, 1860 The Indians attacked the mail 
station at Deep Creek, Tooele County, shot a man 
and stole several horses. 

ATTACK ON SMITHFIELD. JOHN REED 
AND IRA MERRILL KILLED. 

July 22nd Smithfield, Cache County, was attack- 
ed by Indians. A fight ensued: John Reed and Ira 
Merrill and two Indians were killed and several 
others wounded on both sides. The Indians sought to 
liberate one of their number who had been captured 
while stealing horses, but in the melee the guilty In 
dian and another were killed. Previous to this time, 
the Indians made a similar attempt of rescuing 
another at Logan, Cache Valley, Utah, but the 
whites rallied quickly, and in force, defeated the at- 
tempt.

COLONEL CONNOR'S COMMAND 
START TO BEAR RIVER. 

On the 19th of January, 1863, a miner named 
William Bevins made affidavit before Chief Jus- 
tice John F. Kinney in Salt Lake City to the effect 
that about ten days previous, he and party number- 
ing eight men, who were on their way to the Grass- 
hopper Gold Mines in Dakota were attacked in 
Cache Valley by Indians and one of their number 
killed. He also reported that another party of ten 
miners enroute to Salt Lake City had been assaulted 
and murdered by the same Indians, in the same 
locality. Upon this information warrants for the 
arrest of three of the chiefs were issued and placed 
in the hands of the United States Marshal Isaac 
L. Gibbs, who, realizing that resistance would be of- 
fered, laid the matter before Colonel Connor. Three 
days later a company of Infantry with two how- 
itzers started for the camp of the hostiles, and on 
Sunday evening the 25th, four companies of cavalry, 
under command of Colonel Connor himself followed. 
Marshal Gibbs accompanied the expedition, though 
with what purpose is not clear, as the mission and 
intent of the troops was to summarily punish, and 
not merely to arrest the savages for the various 
crimes and depredations of which they were ac- 
cused. The Colonel in his report said he informed 
the Marshal that all arrangements for the expedi- 
tion were already made, and that the civil process 
had little to do with it is evident from the Colonel's 
further remarks : being satisfied that they (the In- 
dians) were part of the same band who had been 
murdering emigrants on the overland mail route 



112 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



for the past fifteen years, and the principal actors 
and leaders in the horrid massacre of the previous 
summer. I determined although the weather was 
unfavorable to an expedition to chastise them, if 
possible. Tuesday night the 27th, the cavalry force 
overtook the infantry at Mendon, Cache County ; but 
the infantry at once resumed the march and were 
again overtaken during the following night at Frank- 
lin, twelve miles from the Indian encampment. 

COLONEL CONNOR'S BATTLE AT 
BEAR RIVER. 

At 3 o'clock, on the morning of Jan. 29th, the 
infantry was in motion and an hour later the cavalry 
set out, overtaking and passing their plodding com- 
rades about four miles south of the river. The battle 
began at 6 o'clock. The Indians having detected the 
efforts of the mounted troops to surround them, and 
defeating it by at once engaging them. The posi- 
tion of the savages was one of great natural strength, 
and they had improved it with considerable ingen- 
uity. A narrow dry ravine with steep rocky sides 
sheltered them from the fire of the soldiers, who, 
advancing along the level table land through which 
the gorge ran, were exposed to the murderous vol- 
leys of the concealed foe. Steps cut in the bank en- 
abled the Indians to ascend and descend as necessity 
required, and artificial copses of willows served as 
additional defenses where the ravine 's course left an 
exposed point. The battle opened inauspiciously 
for the troops who quickly saw the disadvantage at 
which they were placed. Several fell killed and 
wounded at first fire. The Indians gleefully not- 



IISTDIAN DEPREDATIONS 113 

ing the fact, and defying the survivors to "come on." 
Meantime the infantry, whose advance had been 
checked by the swift icy waters of the Bear Kiver 
until horses furnished by the cavalry had assisted 
them over the stream, had joined in the engagement; 
and a successful flanking movement soon afterwards 
enabled the troops to pour an infilading fire into the 
enemy's camp. This was the beginning of the end; 
for though the savages fought with fury they were 
now at a disadvantage and were met by a line of sol- 
diers at either end of the ravine, as they moved to- 
wards the lower end. The colonel ordered his troops 
thither, disposing of the calavry so as to cut off 
escape. One company stood at the mouth of the 
gorge and visited terrible execution upon the enemy ; 
at a single spot forty-eight corpses were afterwards 
counted. By ten o'clock the savages were complete- 
ly routed and the slaughter was ended. Two hun- 
dred and twenty-four warriors, it is claimed, where 
found dead upon the field but this number may 
have been exaggerated. Among them were the chiefs 
Bear Hunter, Sagwitch and Lehi. The first it is 
said falling into the fire at which he was moulding 
bullets, and being literally roasted. Sanpitch one 
of the chiefs named in Judge Kinney's warrant made 
his escape, as did also Pocatello, and probably fifty 
braves. The fighting strength of the Indians were 
estimated to be over three hundred. One hundred 
and sixty squaws and children fell into the hands 
of the victors, and one hundred and seventy-five 
ponies were captured in the camp; seventy lodges 
were burned; and a large quantity of grain, imple- 
ments and other property believed to have been 
stolen from emigrants. That which was not neces- 



114 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

sary for the captives was either destroyed or carried 
to Camp Douglas and sold. On his side Colonel 
Connor lost fourteen men and forty-nine were wound- 
ed during the engagement. Eight died within ten 
days. The force in the outset numbered three hun- 
dred men. But not more than two hundred were in 
the fight; the remainder were either teamsters or 
men incapacitated by frozen feet. The hardships of 
the journey were extreme. The snow being deep and 
the cold intense. The casualties of this latter class 
were seventy-nine, and the commanding officer in 
his report expressed the fear that many of the vic- 
tims would be crippled for life. Colonel Connor em- 
ployed as his guide on this expedition the experien- 
ced Mountaineer Orrin P. Rockwell, who rendered 
the command very efficient service; without which 
it is believed many more of the soldiers would have 
perished by being frozen. This fact accounts for 
the friendly feeling that Connor always entertained 
towards Rockwell. 

The dead and wounded arrived at Camp Doug- 
las on the night of the 2nd of February and on Wed- 
nesday the 4th, the survivors were again at their 
quarters. Next day, the 5th, fifteen of the dead were 
buried with military honors. Theirs being the con- 
secrating dust of the beautiful little cemetery at the 
fort. On the 6th, Lieutenant Darwin Chase who 
died of his wounds on the night of the 4th, at Farm- 
ington was buried with Masonic and martial honors ; 
he had once been a Mormon Elder. At dress parade 
on Sunday, the 8th, the colonel's complimentary or- 
der was read, and that same day the two who were 
the last to die of their wounds were placed by the 
side of their deceased comrades. If the battle in its 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 115 



latest stage had possessed less of the elements of a 
massacre Colonel Conner and his command would 
have been more generally praised by the people ; but 
perhaps it would not then have proved a lesson so 
well to be remembered by the savages. As it was, it 
completely broke the power of the Indians there 
and conveyed to them a warning that it has never 
been necessary to repeat. In a letter to General 
Wright commanding the department of the Pacific, 
General in Chief Halleck wrote from Washington 
under the date of March 29th, highly praising the 
courage and discretion of the colonel and his brave 
Californians. And in a dispatch of the same date to 
Colonel Connor, he and his command were congratu- 
lated on their heroic and brilliant victory. And the 
commander was notified that he was that day ap- 
pointed a brigadier general. 

ATTACK ON A PLATOON OF SOLDIERS 
AT PLEASANT GROVE. 

April 12th. William H. Seegmiller of Rich- 
field, Sevier County, Utah, gives the following ac- 
count of a fight between a small party of soldiers 
from Camp Douglas and a band of Indians under 
chief Little Soldier at Pleasant Grove, Utah County. 

Eeturning from San Pedro (Cal.) with Wood- 
mansee Bros. ' freight train, Sam Serine, captain, on 
the evening of April 12, 1863, we camped at Pleas- 
ant Grove, Utah County. We had been camped but 
a short time when a band of Indians, probably fifty, 
under the leadership of Little Soldier came to our 
camp and inquired if we were Americats. We aas- 
wered no, and he then asked if we knew where the 



116 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

Americats were camped, we told them that we did 
not know. They then said: 'we find them.' They 
passed on down the street towards the center of town. 
Some of Brigadier General Connor's command from 
Fort Douglas were in town, we saw two or three wa- 
gons with heavy canvas covers on and some mules ; 
also teamsters and a few soldiers. Soon we heard 
a loud report, and learned that Connor's men had 
found out that the Indians were coming for them, 
and had shot a "Howitzer" a small cannon, at them 
as they were turning to go south to where the sol- 
diere were located. We were informed that the sol- 
diers went to Samuel Green's house on the east side 
of the road and asked the people to leave, which, 
they did in a hurry. The soldiers then went into 
the house, pulled their cannon in with them, pulled 
up some of the floor and got under it leaving their 
wagons in the road and their mules and horses were 
in a corral on the west side of the street. The In- 
dians dared not follow the troops into the house, but 
shot into it through the door and window, pepper- 
ing the back wall with bullets. When the Indians 
saw they could not successfully rout the soldiers or 
kill them, they turned their attention to booty. But 
when the soldiers saw they were going to lose their 
horses they fired a charge of grape shot from their 
cannon into the corral at their animals, prefering 
to kill them to letting the Indians get them, they 
killed and maimed some, the Indians got those not 
hurt and loaded them with blankets and supplies, 
and struck for the mountains very much pleased 
with their success as manifested by their chatter 
and antics. 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 117 

When the first shot was fired from the cannon 
it was not aimed at the Indians but over them to 
ecare and stop them, it was loaded with a bomb which 
v>ent over the Indians and corral and struck and ex- 
ploded in William H. Adam's field west of town 
about where the railroad track now is. Some of 
this information is given by Wm. H. Adams, Jr., an 
eye witness. When the Indians left, some of the men 
of town went to the house where the soldiers were 
to learn from them what should be done, and were in- 
formed that a company of soldiers were follow- 
ing them. These men went in the night soon after 
dark and found this company camped at the Warm 
Springs at the point of the mountain in the south 
end of Salt Lake Valley, and reported. They im- 
mediately broke camp and proceeded to Pleasant 
Grove. 

W. H. Seegmiller continues : 

The following morning I went down town and 
found Brigadier General Connor and quite a num- 
ber of his cavalry. Orrin Porter Rockwell was also 
with them. They had arrived during the previous 
night. On the day before the attack by Little Soldier 
and his warriors we learned at Spanish Fork that 
some of General Connor's soldiers, on the bench 
above Spanish Fork met an Indian, Pintutch, going 
to his wickiup from town and killed him on the edge 
of a ditch in the southwest corner of town, by beat- 
ing him over the head with their muskets. That no 
doubt was the cause of Little Soldier and his band 
attacking General Connor's outfit at Pleasant Grove. 
I will ever remember the appearance of Little Sold- 
ier and his Indians. None of them wore much 
clothing, a breech clout and mocassins were their 



118 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

uniform; their faces were painted black, all seemed 
to have guns and pistols, and some had bows and 
quivers of arrows. On April 13th, we arrived in 
Salt Lake City. Having been invited by President 
Brigham Young before starting to .California to call 
on him on my return. I did so on the evening of my 
return. While I was conversing with the President, 
Orrin Porter Eockwell called and gave President 
Young an account of the affair with the Indians at 
Pleasant Grove. I listened very attentively to his 
recital of the matter, and he freely told the above as 
I understood it. 

0. Porter Rockwell while at Pleasant Grove was 
taken to be slightly intoxicated. He was active in 
moving among the crowd at the soldiers ' camp ; this 
all seems very distinct even now, I thought him al- 
most silly with drink and had little respect for him, 
until this interview with President Young. On that 
occasion he was well dressed in a black broadcloth 
suit, wore neatly polished shoes and a black silk 
hat ; his language was free and grammatical. I con- 
cluded then that Eockwell lived a double live in the 
interest of his friends and God's cause on the earth. 
I will ever remember him with esteem. ' ' 

INDIAN OUTRAGE IN BOXELDER 
COUNTY, WM. THORP KILLED. 

Copied from Desert News, Vol. 12, page 364. 

On the afternoon of Friday last, May 18th, 
as reported by Mr. Burt, of Brigham City, six 
or eight Indians of Sagwitch's band, as supposed, 
made their appearance in Box Elder Canyon, or in 
the Little Valley, about four miles from Brigham 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 119 

City at a herd house, and made inquiry of a boy 
who was there alone relative to the whereabouts of 
the soldiers. The boy replied that he did not know, 
but supposed they were in Salt Lake City, for he had 
not heard that any portion of General Connor's 
command was moving northward. The savages told 
the boy he was a liar, and designated the place where 
the soldiers camped the night before. They then 
took the lad's hat and two horses that were near by 
and went to the herd some distance away, where they 
got eight or nine more, which they succeeded in driv- 
ing off, making ten or eleven in all. They made a 
strenuous effort to drive away the entire herd of 
cattle grazing in the canyon, but were prevented by 
eight or ten Danishmen, who were making a farm in 
the valley not far from the herd. These men were 
unarmed, but on seeng the movements of the free- 
booters, they immediately took measures to defeat 
their object, which, after a severe struggle with the 
red men, they succeeded in accomplishing. On being 
convinced that they could not get the cattle, the In- 
dians fled with the horses, and in their flight came 
upon a man by the name of William Thorp who was 
burning coal in the side canyon, whom they killed 
with arrows, the party having no guns. The body 
of the murdered man was found the following day 
considerably mutilated. 

STAGE ATTACKED IN CEDAE VALLEY, 
TWO MEN KILLED. 

June 10th. The Stage Coach was attacked by 
mounted Indians between Fort Critenden and the 
Jordan River, Utah County. The driver, Wood

Beynolds and another man was killed and their 
bodies fearfully mutilated by the savages. 

TREATY AT BRIGHAM CITY, WITH 
SH03HONE INDIANS. 

July 30. Governor Doty and General Connor 
made a treaty of peace with the Shoshone Indians 
at Brigham City. 

In August, the troops under command of Cap- 
tain Smith killed twelve Indians near Shell Creek 
Station, Utah. 

STATEMENT BY N. 0. ANDERSON OF EPHRAIM. 

On June 1st, 1863, I was in company with Ras- 
mus Hansen Kleurke and James P. Larsen. We 
were driving a band of horses south along a steep 
wash known as Willow Creek Wash, we saw three 
Indians, who were on the west side of the wash, 
while we were on the east side. When we came to 
them I recognized one of them as Jake Arrapeen, 
the old chief's son with whom I was well acquainted. 
I was about two rods from him when he pointed 
his gun at me. I looked at his gun, saw that the 
hammer was back and that his finger was on the 
trigger. Speaking to James Larsen, he said "Let 
us run a race." Larsen answered in the negative, 
which did not suit him, so he pointed his gun at 
James. Easmus seeing the Indian pointing his gun 
asked, "Is he pointing at you, boys." We answered 
that he was. Easmus who was one hundred and fifty 

yards distant, said, "Tell him to go to H ." At 

that the Indian raised his gun and shot at Easmus, 
the ball passing close by Jim and me as we were in 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 121 



line.. It passed in front of Rasmus, just over the 
horn of his saddle. We then all rode up to Jake an<l 
Rasmus said, "If I had my pistol here, I would 
shoot you, you son of a B . ' ' While Jake was load- 
ing his gun as fast as he could, we put spurs to our 
horses and rode to James Sanford Allred and told 
him what Jake Arrapeen had done. Brother Allred 
told us Jake was mad and would kill some one. The 
Indians went up the canyon, we could see their dust, 
and that was the last time that I ever saw Jake 
Arrapeen. 

My object in writing a sketch of this kind is to 
show that while there was not really a war on, at 
that time, it was plain that the Indians could not be 
depended upon. 

HERDSMAN C. C. ROWE IN THISTLE VALLEY. 

By Conderset Rowe and Peter Gottfredson. 

In Thistle Valley. 

From the close of the Tintic War in 1856, the 
Indians were comparatively peaceable till 1863. Then 
they became dissatisfied, thinking that the Whites 
were encroaching upon their rights by crowding them 
off their lands and hunting grounds. They would 
often say. "White man's horses, cows and sheep eat 
Indian's grass. White man burn Indian's wood, 
shoot Indian's buckskins, rabbits, etc." And they 
frequently wanted horses, cattle or sheep in payment 
for it. Often they would bring an order from the 
Bishop, or some one for a beef or a mutton, and in 
such cases they always wanted the best. In the 
summer of 1863, the Mount Pleasant dry stock and 
sheep were taken into Thistle Valley, at the head 



122 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

of the South Fork of Spanish Fork Canyon to be 
herded. Caratat Rowe, his son (Conderset Rowe) 
and a hired boy (Peter Gottfredson) were caring 
for horned stock. Nathan Staker and his sons, Aaron 
and Joseph were herding the sheep. One day. about 
dusk, in the fore part of October, 1863, an Indian 
came to our camp while we were out milking. He 
rode a fine cream colored horse, bare backed, having 
as he said, left his saddle and gun down near the 
wagon road. He was dressed in a new military 
officer's uniform with gilt epaulets on the shoulders, 
and said his name was Godfrey. We did not learn 
to what tribe he belonged. He asked for something 
to eat and we told him that as soon as we were 
through milking, we would have supper. He ate sup- 
with us. After eating, he asked if he could stay all 
night, saying he had no blankets. We told him he 
could. As Rowe and Staker had gone to Mount 
Pleasant after supplies, we four boys constituted the 
whole personel of the camp. The Indian told us 
that the Snake Indians had killed eight men in Provo 
Canyon, and said that may be at daylight they would 
come and kill us and steal our cattle. He seemed 
to be very uneasy and would listen attentively at 
every little noise and say, * ' maybe Snakes. ' ' He ask- 
ed to see our guns, Aaron Staker got the guns, a 
rifle and a shotgun, both muzzle loaders. Then he 
wanted to see our ammunition, but I had hidden it 
under the bedding where Staker could not find it. 
The Indian next wanted to know how much powder 
we had. I showed on my hand that we had about 
five inches in the powder-horn. We had only four 
or five charges for our guns. Every little while 
the Indian would listen and say Snakes, as I thought 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 123 

to try to scare us Howe had a wagon which he 
had made himself, the wheels being cut off the big 
end of a large red pine log. he worked oxen on this 
primitive wagon and we could hear the wagon squeak 
miles away. As Brother Rowe was coming with sup- 
plies late in the night, the Indian heard the wagon 
squeek again said Snakes. Conderset replied "na 
nini-montz-pege ' ' my father is coming. This was 
about ten or eleven o'clock in the night. As Rowe 
drove up, the Indian took Condersets hat and put on 
his own head and stood astradle of the fire. We did 
not understand why. Rowe looked at the Indian and 
said. "boys, he is here for no good." Conderset 
told his father what the Indian said about the In- 
dians killing eight men in Provo Canyon. Rowe 
began asking the Indian questions about it. The 
Indian said that it was eight sleep ya-tes, eight 
days since, holding up eight fingers. Rowe said, 
"You are mistaken, for if it was so, the papers would 
talk about it. ' ' The Indian became uneasy and want- 
ed to go to his saddle. Rowe said, "I will go with 
you." The Indian seemed willing that he should 
do so till he got his horse, when he said his horse's 
back was sore, which was very common with Indian 
horses. Rowe told the Indian that he would walk 
for he was anxious to keep the Indian with us all 
night. He also told the Indian that there would be 
ten men there by morning, and ten more later, word 
having reached Mount Pleasant, that the Indians 
intended making a raid on Thistle Valley. Upon hear- 
ing this the Indian became more eager to go than 
ever, he jumped on his horse and was gone, and we 
saw no more of him. Mr. Rowe remarked that trou- 
ble was brewing, and that we would have to shift 



124 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

for ourselves as best we could. About midnight, 
after we had conversed about what we would do in 
case we were attacked, we heard a yell down in the 
valley in the direction of the road. Eowe said: 
" there comes the boys." We boys fearing that it 
it might be Indians, planned what to do if such 
should be the case. It proved to be four boys from 
Mt. Pleasant, namely R. N. Bennet, Don C. Seely, 
Peter Miller and James Hansen. They told us that 
as they were coming up from the road, they saw a 
small fire up Indian Hollow, and started towards it, 
when they got onto a ridge and saw our fire, and 
came to it. We got supper for them. We looked 
for more men in the morning, but they did not come. 
We gathered the stock and sheep and drove to Mt. 
Pleasant. At Fairview we got supper at Gammet's. 
There was no further trouble with Indians that fall, 
but we always believed that if we had not received 
timely help we might have been murdered. 

HERDSMEN JENS GOTTFREDSON AND OLE 
JENSEN IN THISTLE VALLEY. 

P. Gottfredson. 

My father, Jens Gottfredson, had taken the 
Mount Pleasant dry stock to herd in Thistle Valley, 
and also stock from Moroni and Fairview, as well 
as a part of the Mt. Pleasant sheep. An old gentle- 
man named Ole Jensen had charge of the remainder 
of the sheep. Six or seven families from Fairview 
had settled in the Valley, about six miles from the 
herd house that we occupied. All went well till along 
in August, 1864, when the Indians became hateful to 
the families down the valley and demanded a lot of 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 125 

lllllllllillllllllllllllMIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIII I II II 

horses and cattle for the land, or they wanted them 
to move off, and they made some threats. The peo- 
ple consequently moved back to Fairview. A few 
days later fifty or more Indians came up to where 
we were, about a half mile south west of the pres- 
en site of Indianola. The old gentleman Jensen was 
northeast of the herd house, about one quarter of a 
mile, taking out his sheep. An Indian rode up to 
him and asked for his dinner, which he had wrapped 
up in his coat. Brother Jensen refused, whereupon 
the Indian grabbed his coat and dinner and jerked it 
away from him, laying it across his saddle in front 
of him. The old man caught the horse by the bridle 
with one hand and his coat with the other, and with a 
quick pull got the coat away from the Indian, nearly 
pulling him off his horse. Jensen followed his sheep, 
and after getting away about 75 yards, the Indian 
fired at him; the bullet grazed his face and killed 
two sheep in the herd. 

My brother and I were a short distance west of 
the herdhouse when another Indian who had seven 
or eight dogs with him, came after us and made for 
our sheep. We had a large brindle dog which had 
been brought in with Gen 7 ! Johnston's Army. We 
sicked him after the Indian dogs and he threw them 
right and left ; this stopped their rush for the sheep. 
The Indian then came towards me. He had, besides 
a gun and bow and arrows, a large painted wagon 
spoke, with a string through the small end, hung on 
his wrist. I suppose he used to whip his horse with. 
As he rode up to me, acting as if he wanted to hit 
me with it, I kept backing away from him, but could 
not move fast enough to keep out of his reach. I 
asked him what he wanted, and what was the matter 



126 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

with him, but he would not talk. When I saw I could 
not back fast enough to keep out of his way I 
squatted down, cocked my gun and with my finger on 
the trigger pointed it at his face. He jerked his 
horse back so quick having what we called a jaw- 
breaker bit, that the horse fell back on his haunches 
but the Indian stayed with the horse. He then be- 
gan to talk. He asked what the people said who 
moved up from below. I said "nothing." He said, 
"you lie." I told him that they said the Indians 
wanted more horses and cattle for the land than it 
was worth. He said, "all right" and rode to the 
herdhouse where all the Indians had gathered by 
this time. They broke open the door and went in 
and took and carried away all our bedding, provis- 
ions and cooking utensils, and other things, and 
started towards Fairview. When near the divide, 
they met Lyman Peters, coming to Thistle Valley, 
and when they saw his head over the ridge, they 
pulled their guns out of their cases. Peters saw it, 
got off his horse, turned it between him and the In- 
dians, laid his gun across the saddle, pointing it 
towards them, and asked what they wanted. They 
answered "navish" nothing, placed their guns back 
in the cases and came on. As they passed Peters, 
one of them made a grab for Peters' gun, but as 
Peters struck at the Indian with his gun, the Indian 
dodged and hit his own horse on the shoulder, lam- 
ing him. 

Peters then came down to where we were and we 
told him what the Indians had done. Just then one 
lone Indian, who had been hunting, came down 
through the brush on foot. When he was off about 
three hundred yards, Peters rested his gun on a 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 127 



knob on the corner of the house, cocking it and said, 
"Now see me make that Indian jump ten feet in the 
air." I told him not to shoot as that would cause 
trouble. He answered, * ' No one will ever know it. ' ' 
Believing that he intended to shoot I pushed the gun 
off the knob. 

Before the Indian came up, Peters had set his 
gun against the house ; it was a large new rifle. The 
Indian took hold of the gun to look at it, but Peters 
took the gun from the Indian saying, "You let that 
be. ' ' The Indian answered * i You mad. ' ' Peters said, 
"Yes, I am mad." The Indian said: "Hombo (what) 
make you mad." and shoved his finger around on 
his body, saying "You bullets no pass." Lyman 
Peters took a handful of large bullets from his pock- 
et and, showing them to the Indian, said, "Don't you 
think they will pass." The Indian started off, look- 
ing back over his shoulder till he got a long way off. 

A week or two before this happened, a small 
band of Indians came to my brother and I, and said 
they wanted a beef. We told them the animals were 
not ours, and they would have to get an order from 
Bishop Seely. A large five year old steer belonging 
to Chris Wintergreen was near, and an Indian raised 
his gun to shoot it. My brother pulled the gun down. 
Another Indian struck him in the face with a lariat, 
making it bleed, and said ' ' Can't you cry ? ' ' Then the 
Indian with the gun shot the steer ; they skinned the 
hind parts and cut out what meat they wanted, 
leaving the hide and balance of meat. The Indian 
who struck my brother seemed to be making love to 
a young squaw who was riding another horse. The 
same Indians killed some cattle in the immediate 
vicinity of Fairview. In order to avoid further 



128 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

trouble we had to move the stock and sheep out of 
Thistle Valley. They also took a herd of sheep from 
some herd boys, drove them off quite a distance, 
killed one sheep and turned the balance loose. James 
M. Allred happened on them just as they were roast- 
ing the mutton on the fire. He said that they drew 
their guns on him. Just at that time Jehu and Elias 
Cox, fathers of the boys from whom the Indians had 
taken the sheep, rode up; they shot at the Indians 
who went off in a hurry.

CHAPTER II. 

THE BLACK HAWK WAR. 

TREATY AT MANTI. 
THE JOHN LOWRY AFFAIR. 

Several stories are told as to how the Black 
Hawk war started, and these stories conflict in sev- 
eral essentials. It is well known that many of the 
Indians, were dissatisfied and unfriendly, and that 
during the years 1863 and 1864 they had committed 
several acts unfriendly towards the white people; 
thus they had stolen some horses and killed a num- 
ber of cattle, at different places, and it needed but a 
pretext to open hostilities. 

During the winter of 1864-65, a small band of 
Indians were camped near Gunnison, Sanpete Co. 
It is said that they had contracted small-pox, and 
that many of them died. 

The Indians seemed to think that the white 
people were to blame in some way for this and were 
threatening to kill the whites and steal their horses 
and cattle. Arrangements were consequently made 
for a meeting between the Indians and the whites 
at Manti on the 9th of April, 1865, to talk over mat- 
ters. 

On that date a number of prominent Utes came 
to Manti. They met at Jerome Kemp ton's place, and 
it appeared that an understanding would be arrived 
at, but a young chief (Yene-wood) also known as 
Jake Arropeen could not be pacified ; he kept talking- 



130 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

and making demonstrations, trying to persuade 
the other Indians against making peace. John Lowry 
and Archibald W. Buchanan were interpreters and 
leading spokesmen on the peoples ' side. 

John Lowry, who was said to be under the influ- 
ence of liquor, demanded of Chief Yene- woods (Jake 
Arropeen) that he should keep quit and let him 
(Lowry) finish talking, when some one spoke, saying, 
"Look out, he is getting his arrows." Whereupon 
Lowry stepped up, caught hold of the Indian and 
pulled him off his horse, and he was about to abuse 
him in some way, when some of the by-standers in- 
terferred. Indian Joe mounted his horse and rode 
out to an Indian camp at Shumway Springs, where 
he reported what had happened. This caused a big 
excitement among the Indians who sent out their 
runners to distant Indian camps with the informa- 
tion. In consequence the Indians generally broke 
camp and moved into the mountains. Those at Rich- 
field went to Salina to join those from Sanpete. 

P. LUDVIGSON, BARNEY WARD AND 
J. P. ANDERSON KILLED.

It was reported that the Indians were going to 
steal stock. Consequently, early in the morning of 
the 10th, a small party of men from Manti went out 
to the Indian Farm at Twelve Mile Creek to gather 
the stock, which was turned out there, to bring them 
home. On the way they were attacked by a number 
of Indians, who killed Peter Ludvigsen and put the 
others to flight. A. W. Buchanan says that he 
and Fred Cox went out to the Indian camp at 
Shumway Springs to have a talk with Chief "White 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 131 

Eye." On their arrival there they handed their 
bridle reins to a young Indian to hold, while they 
went into the chief's tent. The chief at first seem- 
ed sullen and would not talk. Buchanan told him 
what they had come for, and finally the chief called 
for his pipe. Buchanan now knew that he would get 
a hearing, and finally the chief said that only one 
Indian and one white man were mad, and that if he 
and Cox would go with him he would get back the 
stock which the Indians had taken. 

The brethern named reported at Manti, but 
the people were not willing that they should go, be- 
lieving that the Indians were treacherous and were 
likely to kill them ; hence the venture was not made. 

After the Indians had taken the stock and killed 
Ludvigsen, they went to Salina canyon where they 
were joined by Indians from Richfield, and they 
quickly gathered up most of the Salina cattle and 
drove them up Salina canyon to Soldier Fork, where 
they came onto Barney Ward and James P. Ander- 
sen who, not knowing that the Indians were mad, 
fell an easy prey to them. 

It appeared that the Indians had held these two 
men prisoners for a time before killing them; they 
were both shot with many bullets and arrows and the 
condition in which their bodies were found suggested 
that they had been tortured. They were scalped 
and most of their clothing taken. Their bodies were 
not recovered until the next day. During the follow- 
ing night many white men arrived at Salina, from 
in the Sanpete settlement. 

The Indian Agent in Sanpete at the time was 
Fred J. Keisel, since mayor of Ogden whose pru- 
dence in withholding the supply of powder and lead 



132 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



from the savages and giving it to the settlers, help- 
ed the prospect somewhat, but the situation was 
very strained, and the witness to the indignity of- 
fered the Chief at Manti as already noted felt the 
affront had furnished the spark to kindle the In- 
dians ' vengeance into full fury. Learning later in 
the evening that a raid was contemplated upon the 
cattle of the settlement, a small body of horsemen 
started for the feeding grounds. 

Early next day they encountered the Indians who 
opened fire, killing a young man named Peter Lud- 
vigsen. and put his comrades to flight, mutilated 
his body, and then made off with a herd of stock. 

Hostilities now being formally opened, the vic- 
torious bands broke for the mountains to the south- 
east. 

Near Salina, Sevier County, on the same day 
they killed and scalped two men, one being the vete- 
ran Barney Ward, and the other a Mr. Lamson, 
(James P. Andersen) and drove off a large number 
of stock into the adjoining canyon. 

COL. ALLRED WITH 84 MEN DEFEATED 
IN SALINA CANYON. 

A company of cavalry was quickly mustered into 
service under Colonel Reddick N. Allred and started 
in pursuit, but having chased the savages ten miles 
into the mountains, they were compelled April 12th 
to retire before the deadly fire of the ambushed foe, 
with the loss of two men killed, Jens Sorensen and 
William Kearns, and two wounded. 

Reinforcements having been received, another 
advance was ordered two or three days later, when 



INDIAN DBPBEDATIONS 133 



the bodies of the two militia-men were recovered 
and the Indians were pursued into the rugged coun- 
try between Fish Lake and' the Grand River. A 
spirited engagement took place and the Indians 
repulsed with heavy loss. 

From a write-up by Joshua W. Sylvester (form- 
erly Bishop of Elsinore, Sevier County) we obtain 
the following: 

"It was in the spring of 1865, when we were 
busy plowing and planting, that the news came to 
Gunnison, where we lived, that the Indians had 
killed a man at Twelve Mile Creek, that they had 
gone up Salina Canyon and killed Barney Ward and 
another man, and driven off all the Salina stock. 

The next morning a company of us started with 
Bishop Kearns to look for a band of horses. While 
we were out of town word came from Manti to raise 
men and ammunition, and to proceed to Salina as 
soon as possible. Not finding the horses, (as the 
Indians had taken them), we were returning home, 
when, about half way between Gunnison and Salina, 
we met the Gunnison boys, (the sons of Bishop 
Kearns with them), who said they had my bedding 
with them, expecting me to go with the expedition. 
I told them it was no use for me to go, as I had only 
one bullet for my gun; but William Kearns said, 
"Come on, you'll get some bullets. " Consequently 
Andrew Anderson and I went on while the Bishop 
and others returned home. We found men gathered 
at Salina from all parts of Sanpete. I began inquir- 
ing for bullets, when I was informed that Barney 
Ward had been seen moulding some for his pistol 
which were the size I wanted, and as he did not 
have his pistol with him when he was killed, it was 



134 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

thought the bullets were in his trunk. Some one 
went with me to get them; it was dark and we had 
no light. And as Ward's corpse was laid out on the 
trunk, or chest, we had to raise him up, while I 
searched for the bullets, until I found them. 

Firing off the bullet I had in my gun the next 
morning, and reloading with a good charge of pow- 
der, I started with the posse up the canyon, in order 
to overtake the Indians and recover the stock, as 
they had driven off all the stock at Salina. We follow- 
ed the trail through narrow places, above precipices 
and under cliffs, till we came to a place where they 
had killed a beef. There we put on an advance 
guard and proceeded till we passed a very narrow 
place on the trail, when an Indian fired a signal gun, 
and immediately they all fired on us from the rocks 
above on the steep mountain side. We found that 
we were trapped. Colonel Allred then gave orders 
for a retreat to a ridge, in order to flank the Indians, 
and where we made a stand. Bullets were passing 
over our heads like hail, and had the Indians known 
how their guns were carrying they could have shot 
us down fast. In being shot down hill a bullet will 
raise, so they over-shot. However, their trap was 
well laid, for they had arranged to close in on the 
trail behind us; but an unexpected move on our 
part frustrated their plan. The officers found 
that they were getting a cross fire, and as they had 
worked down on the mountain, called for another 
retreat to the next ridge, in order to flank. 

Some of our men, not understanding the order 
from the commanding officer, went too far, which 
hindered the Indians from closing the trail, but 
they had got so far down the mountain that they 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 135 



could get good shots at us while we could not see one 
of them. William Kearns was shot from his horse 
and killed while riding beside his brother Austin, 
who had to leave him where he fell, in order to save 
his own life. 

The following statement is from Austin Kearns 
himself : 

"When we made our second stand, after we 
had been fired upon by the Indians, I noticed one par- 
ticular Indian behind a big rock. He had loaded and 
fired his gun three or four times, and I asked com- 
rade Anderson, my companion, who stood near me to 
hold my horse while I went up the hill-side to take a 
shot at the Indians. I laid down, resting my gun on a 
root. While I lay there a ball struck near me, causing 
the dirt to fly in my face. When I looked up I saw 
my comrades were making a quick retreat down the 
canyon. I then returned to Anderson who handed 
me my reins and I mounted and followed the com- 
pany. But instead of my horse following the trail, 
he turned in the opposite direction, jumped into a 
patch of oak brush, and tried to force his way 
through. By doing so he got fast and was unable 
to get out. I had matcher es (heavy leather covers) 
on my saddle; they spread out, holding me fast. 
While trying to get out the Indians were coming 
closer; they cross-fired in quick succession on me 
from three directions, and perhaps fifty or more 
shots were aimed at me while in that condition. 
At last the string in front of the horn of the saddle 
broke and I raised up letting the matcheres with 
my wool blankets slide off, freeing the horse. 
All my companions had gone, leaving me alone with 
the howling Indians who thought sure they would 



136 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

have my scalp. I escaped without a scratch, al- 
though bullets had been flying around me like hail, 
cutting the oaks all around me. It surely was an 
exciting time." 

Mr. Sylvester continues his narrative as follows : 

"William Kearn's horse worked along the trail 
with the crowd. Therefore, when the second retreat 
was ordered there was no chance to flank ; we were 
not acquainted with Indian warfare then, but this 
experience made us look out ever after. Had there 
not been a providential move at this point, there 
could have been a massacre equal to that of General 
Ouster's of a later date for bullets flew everywhere 
and we could not see where they came from. 

We saw four Indians run across the canyon to 
get a cross-fire on us. One of them, quite a distance 
up the canyon, was swinging his hands to the others 
on the mountain, motioning to them to work down. 
Some of us fired at him and he fell from his horse. 
This incident was followed by a lull in the firing 
for a few moments of which we made good use. 
The Indians afterwards reported that the Indian we 
had shot soon got well, but was afterwards killed by 
another Indian. 

I will here relate an incident that occurred dur- 
ing the second retreat which was called, when we 
reached the top of the ridge. I was cinching my sad- 
dle when a man came up the trail, holding to the tail 
of another man's horse ; he was nearly exhausted. A 
mule was seen near by that had thrown a man who 
was afterwards killed by the Indians. This man was 
Jens Sorenson of Ephraim. The animal worked its 
way down the trail, but stood entangled in the reins. 
The man on the horse called out "Get that mule." 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 137 

The exhausted fellow reached the animal, but had 
no knife. I took my knife from my belt and ran to 
him, leaving it with him. I returned to my horse. 
The cinch of my saddle was so long that the rings met 
and I had a heavy pack on behind, so, when I endea- 
vored to mount, the saddle turned with me. I wanted 
my knife then, but the man had gone and so had every 
body else. I then had to undo a long strap, but about 
that time the bullets were coming toward me thick 
and fast. I threw the whole business down, jumped 
on my horse bareback and soon overtook the others. 
I saw the man to whom I had loaned my knife, and 
asked him what he had done with it. Taking it from 
his pocket he said, " Are you the man who let me take 
this knife I It saved my life. ' ' That man was Frank 
H. Hyde. 

We marched on feeling pretty blue, and at the 
mouth of the canyon we met Bishop Kearns. The 
reader may imagine the feelings of the father and 
son thinking of the other son and brother who was 
left a corpse on the trail ; it was indeed a sad scene 
to those who witnessed the same. 

The bodies of Kearns and Sorensen laid in the 
canyon two days before they were rescued, then a 
friendly Indian (Sanpitch) went up and got them. 

When the Indians found that Kearns was an old 
friend with whom they had frequently played and 
hunted, they placed the body against a rock and 
wove willows around it to keep off the wolves ; while 
the man who fell near him was horribly mutilated. 
An Indian (the chief Sanpitch) came in the night 
to Bishop Kearns and reported that it was safe for 
the men to go after the body of his son as the Indians 
had gone.

STATEMENT OF GOTLIEB ENZ. 

Gotlieb Enz of Richfield makes the following 
statement : 

"I came to Richfield in November, 1864, with a 
few head of cattle, having lost a yoke of oxen be- 
tween Gunnison and Salina. Early in April, 1865, a 
band of Indians were camped at Richfield by the 
big spring, and a man by the name of Sutton came 
from Provo to trade with them. He exchanged a 
quantity of ammunition for buckskins. About the 
8th of April, 1865, I went out to hunt for my oxen, 
expecting to find them in the Gunnison field. Being 
on foot, and failing to find them there, I, surmising 
that they might have strayed up Salina Canyon, 
left Gunnison and came to Salina. I called on Ellas 
Crane, who was living in a dugout. The Indians 
had left Richfield and were camped near the mouth 
of Salina Canyon, southeast of town, on the bench. 
I told the Crane family that I was going up the can- 
yon to look for the oxen. Mrs. Crane asked me if 
I was not afraid of the Indians, to which I replied 
that I was not, as I was acquainted with them. 
I left my blankets there and went up the canyon about 
three miles into Soldier Fork. There I found one of 
the oxen. Having walked all day, I sat down on a 
rock to rest. An impression came to me that I 
should not stop there; the same impression came to 
me three different times. Consequently I got up 
and looked around, but saw nothing unusual. I then 
started down the canyon, leaving my ox there feed- 
ing on good grass ; I intended to go after him the next 
day and drive him home. As I went down the can- 
yon, I met two men going up to look for stock; I 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 139 

passed the time of day with them, and went on. Soon 
afterwards I met the Indians going up the canyon, 
most of them on the main road. I saw six or eight 
up on the south side of the canyon, driving up some 
stock. I passed the Indians unmolested and had no 
idea that they were angry. I stayed that night at 
Elias Cranes '. After singing and prayers we retired. 
About midnight a man carrying an express came 
from Gunnison with the information, that the Indians 
were on the war-path, and that the people must pre- 
pare to defend themselves. He further reported that 
the Indians had killed a man near Manti. All the 
people gathered at the little rock meeting house. 
While there a lady said, "My husband went up the 
canyon last evening to look for some stock, and has 
not returned. I wonder what can have become of 
him." This was Mrs. Ward. Then a young lady 
also said, "My brother went up also and has not 
come home. ' ' Towards morning we heard the report 
of some guns, seemingly a long ways off. Thinking 
something might be wrong. I, together with six or 
eight other men, went up the canyon. When we ar- 
rived at the place where I left my ox the previous 
day, we found the two men killed and scalped, and 
most of their clothing removed from their bodies. 
There were a lot of arrows sticking in them, and it 
appeared that the Indians had taken them captive, 
and tortured them for some time before killing them. 
We left the bodies and went down to the settlement 
and reported. A number of men went up with a team 
and brought the bodies down. When preparing the 
remains for burial, we examined them closely. The 
two men had been shot with a number of bullets, and 
many arrows. Some of the latter we were unable 



140 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

to get out, owing to the beards on the spikes. During 
the day a lot of men arrived at Salina from the set- 
tlements in Sanpete and elsewhere/' 

WALTER JONES OF MONROE SERIOUSLY 
WOUNDED. 

On April 15th, 1865, Walter Jones with some 
others were on their way to Marysvale with teams to 
bring out a few families who had located there. 
When on the ridge (before getting into the valley), 
Jones reached down into the wagon to get his din- 
ner. He accidentally pulled the gun, when something 
caught the hammer and discharged it, the load pass- 
ing through Brother Jones ' feet. The accident com- 
pelled him to use crutches for four years. 

JENS LARSEN A SHEEP HERDER KILLED 
NEAR FAIRVIEW. 

In the evening of May 25, 1865, while gathering 
his sheep, Jens Larsen was shot and killed about 
four miles north of Fairview, Sanpete County. His 
daughter Pauline subsequently became the wife of 
Jacob Dastrup of Sigurd, Sevier County. 

JOHN GIVEN, WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN 
MURDERED IN THISTLE VALLEY. 

Between daylight and sunrise on the morning 
of May 26, 1865, the same murderous band attacked 
John Given and family who had moved up Spanish 
Fork Canyon into Thistle Valley and intended locat- 
ing there for the summer. Besides Given and his 
wife, the party consisted of his son John, aged nine-

teen, his daughters Mary, Annie and Martha, aged 
respectively nine, five and three years, and two men 
named Leah and Brown. All were sleeping in a hut 
constructed of willows, Leah and Brown being in a 
wagon box at one end. The former was awakened by 
hearing the cattle running wildly down the canyon, 
and shortly afterwards the firing of the Indians 
through the brush of the hut, apprised him of the 
cause of the alarm. To their concealed position in 
the wagon box the two men owe their escape. The 
other occupants of the hut were speedily killed, the 
blood thirsty Indians completing with arrows and 
tomahawks the work which their first volley had 
begun. Quickly gathering up the flour, axes and 
guns of their victims, they surrounded a herd of 
stock, and after killing the calves, drove off between 
one and two hundred head of horses and cattle into 
the mountains. 

The following details were given by Charles 
Brown, survivor of those who were attacked in 
Thistle Valley when John Given and family were 
massacred : 

Charles Brown and Charles Wager Leah had 
gone into Thistle Valley from their former home, 
together with John Given and family and located in 
the meadow land north of Thistle Creek bridge, in- 
tending to make it their home. They were engaged 
in plowing and planting crops, and had several head 
of cattle and milk cows with calves. 

At daylight on the morning of the 26th of May, 
1865, Leah awoke on hearing stock moving past the 
willow shanty in which the people were all sleeping, 
the two young men, Leah and Browne being in a 



142 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



IIH li 



wagon box at one end of the shanty. When the In- 
dians came to the shanty they poked their guns 
through the willow wall and fired, shooting Mr. 
Given in the region of the heart and Mrs. Given in 
the right cheek. Their son, John, aged nineteen, 
jumped up, saying, "You d d sons of B s." when 
an Indian shot him down before he could reach 
the door. These three were shot before the two 
young men left the cabin. Leah, without dressing, 
grabbed his gun and ran out, hiding in the willows, 
and Brown, who slipped on his clothing, ran 
out at the same time. An Indian fired at them, the 
ball passing between them, striking the ground about 
two rods ahead of them. Browne ran to the creek 
and waded down it, the water being up to his arm- 
pits and very cold. When down the creek some dis- 
tance he got out and went down the side hill about 
six miles to where Dr. Joseph S. Wing and five other 
families from Fairview had located and reported 
what had happened. They all left and went to Fair- 
view. When they came to the Given cabin they 
found T.he three grown persons lying dead on the 
floor of the hut with the feathers of the feather bed 
scattered over them, and also the three young girls, 
Mary, aged nine, Annie, five, and Martha, three 
years old, in the wagon box killed. Oscar Barton, 
one of the rescuers from Mount Pleasant, says : ' ' On 
the morning of the killing, between daylight and 
sunrise, Andrew Larson of Mount Pleasant who had 
camped during the night with the Wing family 
passed the Given place on the road, and as he passed 
he lieard calves bawling in the corral. Thinking 
that the people had not yet arisen, he passed on, 
but when he reached the herd house, about where In- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 143 



it tin nun 11111:11 ii nit iiniitii in ut iiiiiiiiiiimiu. 



dianola railroad station is now located, he saw horse- 
men about half way up the valley, driving stock east- 
ward toward the mountains. His first impression 
was to unhitch one of his horses and ride up to them, 
but he finally concluded to travel on in the direction 
he was going. 

Brother Barton further reports that one of the 
men who escaped ran to North Bend (Fairview), and 
reported what had happened. An express was im- 
mediately sent from Fairview to Mt. Pleasant. 
Twenty armed men were soon in their saddles and 
on their way to Thistle Valley. A few more men 
joined this Mt. Pleasant company at North Bend, and 
they all arrived at the Given cabin in Thistle Valley 
before noon. Here they found Mrs. Given outside of 
the cabin stripped and lying on her back with her 
head towards the shanty, and John Given Jr. lying 
on the floor on his back with his feet toward the door, 
where he had fallen, being shot in the breast. The 
three girls lay in the wagon box, each with a deep 
tomahawk gash in the left side of the head. They were 
all stripped, with the exception of a small waist 
which the savages had left on each. The bedding 
had all been taken away, together with much of the 
house furnishings, guns, etc. The murdered people 
were taken to Fairview for burial and Charles Brown 
and Charles W. Leah, after attending the funeral, 
went back to Spanish Fork by way of Salt Creek 
Canyon and remained there. 

Ten or twelve of the young calves which had 
been left in the corral on the Given premises were 
found by the brethern tomahawked across the loins 
and were dragging their hind parts. The supposi- 



144 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

tion was that the Indians, fearing that the calves 
would be a hindrance in driving off the stock into 
the mountains, had thus crippled the poor animals 
to prevent them from following their mothers. 

The massacre of the Given family in Thistle 
Valley represents one of the most horrible deeds 
committed by the Indians during the Black Hawk 
war. 

DAVID H. JONES KILLED NEAR FAIBVIEW 

On Friday, May 29, 1865, three days after the 
massacre of the Given family in Thistle Valley, 
David H. Jones, a member of the Mormon Battalion 
and a resident of Fairview, was killed by Indians 
about three miles northwest of Fairview. This kill- 
ing was supposed to be done by the same band of 
Indians that had murdered the Given family. 

Comrade James M. Allred says that ten persons 
killed by Indians are buried in the Fairview ceme- 
tery, namely, John Given, wife and four children, 
Thomas Jones, David H. Jones, Jens Larsen and 
Nathan Stewart. 

INDIANS KILLED AT CIRCLEVILLE 

Although the Indian depredations were raging 
in all directions and many murders had been com- 
mitted by Black Hawk and his band the year before, 
the Piute Indians still remained in Circle Valley 
professing friendship, although they were mis- 
trusted by many of the settlers. Some of their 
actions were so suggestive that the whites felt 
themselves in danger every moment, not knowing 
when a break would be made by these savages on 
the settlement. On Monday, April 21, 1866, an ex- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 145 

press reached Circleville with the news that two of 
the pretended friendly Prates had shot and killed a 
white man who belonged to a party of militia sta- 
tioned some distance up the Sevier River at Fort 
Sanford. This fort, which had been built that 
spring by the militia under Silas Sanford Smith and 
his men was about half way between Circleville and 
Panguitch. Word was immediately sent to the 
people of Circleville to protect themselves against 
the Indians who were camped in their valley. On 
receiving this admonition, the men of Circleville set- 
tlement were called together for consultation, and 
after considerable deliberation it was concluded as 
the best policy to place the Indians encamped near 
their settlement under arrest. Consequently, all the 
able-bodied men of Circleville were mustered into 
service, some on horseback and some on foot. Thus 
organized they proceeded to the Indian camp, which 
they surrounded after dark. They had no trouble or 
occasion, however, to use force as James T. S. and 
Jackson Allred went into the Indian camp and per- 
suaded the savages to come to the meeting house in 
Circleville to hear a letter read, which had just been 
received. All the Indians complied willingly with 
this request, with the exception of one young Indian 
warrior who not only refused to go but commenced 
to shoot at the posse, who returned the fire and killed 
him; the rest of the Indians were guarded in the 
meeting house that night. The letter brought in by 
express was then read to the Indians who were told 
that they would be retained as prisoners, awaiting 
further particulars of the killing of the white man at 
Fort Sanford. The Indians showed resistance, but 
their bows, arrows and knives were taken from them, 



146 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

and thus secured the boys took turns in guarding 
them through the night. 

Toward evening of the next day (April 22nd), 
while the Indians were still being guarded in the 
meeting house, some of them succeeded in getting 
loose and immediately commenced an attack upon the 
guards, knocking two of the men down. There was 
every reason to fear a general break on the part of 
the Indians, and it was decided that the settlement of 
Circleville would be in great danger if the Indians 
were allowed to escape. In the general melee and ex- 
citement which followed the Indians were killed, with 
the exception of a number of children, who were 
taken care of by the settlers. 

After this sad affair there were no more at- 
tacks on Circleville on the part of the savages, but 
companies of militia arrived in the valley from other 
parts of the Territory to assist the settlers in defend- 
ing themselves, and a strong guard was kept around 
the town after that. As there was constant danger 
from attacks by the Indians, the settlers had built 
their houses in fort style around the meeting house, a 
short distance east of where Bishop Peterson lives 
at this writing. The settlers from Marysvale moved 
into Circleville that summer, but as the danger from 
attack by Indians became greater than ever, instruc- 
tions were finally given by the authorities of the 
Church and the men in charge of the militia of the 
Territory, that Circleville, as well as the other places 
on the Upper Sevier, should be vacated and the 
people moved to older and stronger settlements for 
safety. About forty families were at that time 
living at Circleville. The evacuation of the settle- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 147 

ment took place June 20, 1866, most of them going 
north to Sevier and Sanpete Counties, while a few 
crossed the mountains on the west to Beaver and 
other places, leaving their fields of promising grain 
behind unharvested, about 700 acres of land was un- 
der cultivation at the time. About fifteen families 
constituted the population at Marysvale, but it is not 
known how much land they had under cultivation 
when they left their settlement, first to seek refuge in 
Circleville and afterwards to vacate that place again 
for other parts. The fields thus left with growing 
wheat and vegetables were afterwards harvested 
by people from Beaver who came over the mountains 
for that purpose. Circleville and Marysvale were 
the only two settlements in Piute Co. at that time. 

ABOUT 150 HEAD OF STOCK STOLEN FROM 
RICHFIELD. 

The following is from the pen of the author, 
Peter Gottfredson: 

In 1865, the Richfield Canal was completed and 
the water turned into it and the people had got some 
grain planted. It was customary to driva the stock 
down on the river bottom to feed. One Saturday 
evening about one hundred and fifty head were 
driven down to the sand knolls, about a mile north 
of the Glenwood Ford. Together with two other 
boys I was down there all day (Sunday) watching 
them and fishing, and when we left after sundown 
the stock was all right. On Monday morning, about 
daylight, I went down after some oxen belonging 
to myself and my father to finisn putting in grain. 
When I reached the place I could not find any of 



148 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



itmimiiiiimn 



the cattle, but by looking around I soon discovered 
that the tracks led to a cattle ford, about a half a mile 
north of the wagon ford, and that the stock had cross- 
ed the river. The water in the river being high, I 
stripped, and carried my clothing, gun and pistol 
above my head, the water reaching to my arm-pits. 
When safely across I dressed and followed the 
tracks. I thought at first that the cattle had been 
driven east by way of Glenwood but I discovered that 
they had turned south up the river bottoms between 
the river and the Black Ridge, about two miles to tftb 
place where Annabella now is located, then they 
had turned up east through a wide dry wash passing 
Saul's meadow, and up the Glenwood mountain. 
Judging from footprints in the sand (in the wash) 
I concluded that only five Indians had been driving 
the cattle and I thought I could take them away from 
five Indians. I ran from one bend of the dry wash 
to another, carefully going up the points of ridges 
and looking ahead to see if I could discover them. 
I followed in that way up the Glenwood Mountain 
about four miles till I struck the trail that leads 
from Glenwood to Grass Valley. There I met two 
oxen that had broken away from the Indians ; they 
had both been shot several times mostly through the 
neck. One a black Texas ox belonging to me had 
two arrows sticking in its side, nearly in half their 
length. I had not heard the shooting and concluded 
that it was no use to follow any farther, and in fact 
I began to feel somewhat timid. Surmising that the 
Indians must have taken the stock in the evening, 
soon after we left tliem. 

I drove the two oxen down by way of SauPs 
Meadow, through a gulch, to the Glenwood field; 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 149 



there I drove them into a corral and pulled out the 
arrows, after which I drove them to Richfield. When 
I arrived home I learned that a lot of men were out 
hunting for me and the stock, fearing that I had been 
killed somewhere in the brush. Some of the men fol- 
lowed the tracks of the stock the way I had gone; 
others were hunting for me in the river bends. Most 
of them stayed out all day and came home hungry 
and tired. When they learned that I had been home 
since before noon they were cross and thought that 
I should be punished for not coming home to report 
the stock gone, instead of following them. Major 
Higgins notified me to appear in the evening before 
what was called a court martial. I did so and told 
my story. I remember that some of the men sug- 
gested that I should stand some extra guard as a 
penalty for my foolishness. Major Glaus Peter An- 
dersen said, I motion we let him go ; I have done such 
foolish tricks myself. They let me go unpunished. 
During the summer a company of about twelve teams 
went to Andersen's Canyon, south of Monroe, after 
timber, in care of Major Andersen; this man had 
been a major in General Johnston's Army, which 
was sent to Utah in 1857 and he had also belonged to 
a company of rangers in Texas previous to joining 
the army. 

In the evening, at the campfire, I asked Major 
Andersen to tell us one of his fool tricks to which 
he consented by relating the following : On a certain 
occasion while I was doing military service in Texas, 
some Indians took five of the rangers prisoners and 
carried them away with them. It was in the after- 
noon, too late for the company to follow, but I and 
another man volunteered to follow the Indians. We 



150 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 



obtained information as to the direction the Indians 
had taken before dark. We traveled in that direction 
till about midnight, when we came to a creek. Here 
we saw the Indian fires about a mile up the creek. 
We left our horses and waded up creek to the camp. 
The creek bank being about four feet high. Our 
belts were hung with Colts revolvers. We laid the 
pistols on the bank. We saw our comrades stripped, 
tied hand and foot and lying near a fire, while some 
of the savages danced around them and were amus- 
ing themselves by sticking brands of fire on their 
naked bodies. After being eye-witnesses to this re- 
volting scenes I and my companion opened fire with 
a revolver in each hand, and as soon as two revolvers 
were empty we picked up two others and repeated 
the process. The Indians ran for the timber, without 
having time to get their guns, leaving their prisoners. 
My companion and I unbound the men, secured some 
clothing, guns and horses, and got back with our 
comrades the next day. It is needless to say that we 
were highly interested in Major Andersen's story.

GOVERNMENT AID REFUSED. THE MILITIA 
ORDERED OUT. 

Colonel 0. H. Irish, superintendent of Indian 
affairs for Utah, had previously to this called on 
Governor Doty, asking the military authorities at 
Fort Douglas for assistance in repelling these In- 
dian attacks and protecting the settlements ; Lut he 
was naively informed by the commander at the Fort 
that the settlers must take care of themselves 
stating that the California Volunteers had no other 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 151 

duty to perform than to protect the overland Mail 
Eoute. Steps were accordingly taken to muster a 
few companies of cavalry in the southern counties. 

TREATY BY COL. 0. H. IRISH AT SPANISH 
FORK RESERVATION. 

And Superintendent Irish promptly proceeded 
to conclude a treaty with such of the Indian Chiefs 
as appeared friendly. 

The personal influence of President Young con- 
tributed materially to his success in this direction; 
and at a meeting held at the Spanish Fork reserva- 
tion farm on the 8th of June, at which speeches were 
made by Colonel Irish, President Young and others 
of the whites, and by Kanosh, Sowiette, Sanpitch and 
Tabby in behalf of the Indians, the treaty was ac- 
cepted and the Chiefs announced their willingness to 
sign it. Next day another meeting was held, more 
speeches were made and fifteen chiefs attached their 
signatures to the treaty ; Sanpitch, a brother of Wal- 
ker and Arropeen, of earlier notoriety, alone refus- 
ing to sign. He relented, however, a few days later, 
probably being urged thereto by the generous pre- 
sents distributed among his associates. 

By the terms of this treaty the Indians promised 
to move to [Tintah Valley within one year from the 
ratification of the agreement, giving up their title to 
the lands they were then occupying. They were re- 
quired to be peaceful and not go to war with other 
tribes except in self-defense nor to steal from nor 
molest the whites. They were to assist in cultivat- 
ing the reservation lands and to send their children 
to the schools established for their benefit. On its 



152 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 



part the United States government promised to ex- 
tend its protection to them ; farms were to be laid out, 
grist and lumber mills built, schools established, 
houses furnished and annuities paid to the principal 
chiefs ; and the tribes $25,000 for the first ten years, 
$20,000 annually for the next twenty years, and $15, 
000 annually for thirty years thereafter were to be 
distributed. 

The Indians were also to hunt, dig roots and 
gather berries on all unoccupied lands, to fish in their 
accustomed places, and erect houses for the purpose 
of curing their fish. On the 18th of September of the 
same year Colonel Irish successfully negotiated a 
similar treaty with Piede Indians at Pinto, Wash- 
ington County. 

Meanwhile the hostiles were not inactive, and 
notwithstanding the vigilance of the settlers and 
the militia, frequent raids and occasional murders 
were still perpetrated. Some of the smaller settle- 
ments were entirely deserted, and herds of stock 
which had formerly ranged freely over the moun- 
tain's grassy sides were collected in the valleys near 
the larger villages where they could be closely watch- 
ed. Lurking in the adjacent fastnesses the Indians 
would swoop down in the night time or at an unex- 
pected moment, and almost before the startled set- 
tlers were aware, or before the local home guard 
cauld be collected to repel the sally, the bold marau- 
ders would be safe from pursuit in the rugged coun- 
try through whose passes and defiles they success- 
fully drove their stolen cattle. The season's work 
yielded them as plunder two thousand head of cat- 
tle and horses, in obtaining which they had killed 
either by massacre or in fight, between the thirty and

forty whites, including women and children. Black 
Hawk's own numbers in the beginning had not ez- 
ceeded two or three score warriors ; but his success 
gave prestige to his name and strength to his follow- 
ing, so that although he lost about forty of his braves 
during the campaign, his force at the end of the year 
exceeded a hundred men, and when he retired for the 
winter toward the Colorado River he had beef and 
horses for all who wished to join him. Other raids 
during the year 1865, besides those mentioned were 
made near Salina, Sevier County. 

On Wednesday, June 7th, 1865, President Brig- 
ham Young and party accompanied Col. 0. H. Irish 
to the Indian Farm where a treaty was made with 
the Indians. Dimick B. Huntington and George W. 
Bean were interpreters. Col. Irish referred to some 
good acts performed by a few of them and bestowed 
presents upon them. He then read an abstract of a 
treaty which is quite liberal in its provisions, and 
talked to them. He recalled his council and advice to 
them. Kanosh led off on the part of the Indians. 
He was a boy, but Sau-e-ett was an old man and 
could speak; he couldn't, yet he kept trying and 
made quite a speech before he got through. Col. 
Irish talked with one tongue but others had talked 
with two ; they had lied to the Indians ; would Col. 
Irish always talk one way? Brigham Young had 
always talked with one tongue, they knew him, and 
he had never lied to them but had always spoken the 
truth and been their friend. What did he say about 
it? They did not want to sell their land and go 
away ; they wanted to live around the graves of their 
fathers. Sanpitch followed him, and spoke rather 
bitterly, manifesting a strong desire to exert his in- 



154 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

fluence against the treaty. President Young then 
talked to them. He recalled his council and advise to 
them in the past, and assured them he was still their 
friend, and advised them to sign the treaty and ac- 
cept the provisions guaranteed in it for their bene- 
fit. The effect of his advice manifested itself in a 
few moments, most of the chiefs being strongly in- 
clined to act upon it at the time, but Tabby counsel- 
ed waiting a little to calm their minds, so that they 
might act without any excitement of feeling. The 
Pow-wow was consequently adjourned till the next 
morning. 

MEETING WITH THE INDIANS. 

Wednesday morning a little before ten the Pres- 
ident and Company drove down to the farm, where 
under a temporary bowery the Indians were to meet 
Commissioner Irish, to have the treaty talked over. 
There were present, besides Col. Irish, representing 
the United States Government, President Young, 
Elders John Taylor, W. Woodruff, Geo. A. Emith, 
F. D. Richards, Bishop Hunter, Mayor Smoot, Col's 
J. C. Little, R. T. Burton and D. J. Ross, Capt. Win- 
der, Marshal Gibbs and a number of other gentle- 
men from G. S. L. City, Bp. Harrington from Ameri- 
can Fork, Bp. Miller and Col. Pace from Provo, Bp. 
A. Johnson from Springville, Br. G. W. Wilkins pre- 
siding in Sp. Fork, Bp. Fairbanks from Payson, 
Bishop A. Moffat and Col. W. S. Snow from Manti, 
with a considerable number of citizens from neigh- 
boring settlements ; on the part of the Indians, Sau- 
e-ett, Kanosh, Tabby, To-quo-ne, Sanpitch, and ele- 
ven other chiefs of lesser note, with a large crowd 
of Indians. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 155 



On Thursday, 8th, the President and party, in- 
cluding Elder George Q. Cannon, left Payson about 
half past nine in the morning for the farm. 

INDIAN ETIQUETTE. 

As the company approached the farm, a 
small part of Indians stationed on a rising ground, 
notified the main body of the fact, and in a few 
minutes after the party arrived the Indians came 
gently sauntering down on horseback, seemingly en- 
deavoring to keep up an appearance of dignity. All 
the chiefs were present except Sanpitch, who had 
taken suddenly indisposed to attend the meeting 
or be a participant in signing the treaty. 

After a few brief and pertinent remarks by 
Col. Irish, the chiefs manifested their willingness to 
sign, and attach their marks to the documents. Old 
Sau-e-ett as the oldest chief leading; Kanosh, by 
his manner, seemed to think that simply putting his 
mark to the paper was rather small business. I 
afterwards learned that he prided himself somewhat 
on his ability to write his name, a very laudable 
source of pride, for, as is well known, Indians gen- 
erally are in much the same condition of ignorance 
with regard to caligraphy, that the mailed knights 
of Christendom mostly were who bore the banner of 
the cross against the Saracens to rescue Palestine 
from their infidel hands. 

THE TALE AFTERWARDS. 

Col. Irish pointed out to them that if they lived 
up to the conditions of the treaty, they might date 
the commencement of a career of prosperity from 



156 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



that day, encouraging them to do so. 

President Young advised them to remember 
good advice given them, to learn to read and write 
and increase in intelligence, stating in connection, 
that Col. Irish had done all he possibly could for 
them, and that he was their friend and blessed them. 

Kanosh, Tabby and Sow-ok-soo-bet indulged in 
a short talk each, expressive of their good feeling; 
after which the President strongly advised them not 
to punish the innocent for misdeeds of the guilty, 
and if any of their own or other bands should com- 
mit depredations, to catch the guilty ones and deliver 
them up to the authorities of the whites for trial. A 
large amount of presents were distributed among the 
Indians. 

PRES. YOUNG- AND PARTY LEFT G. S. L. 
CITY FOR SANPETE. 

July 7th. President B. Young, and several of 
the twelve and others left G. S. L. City on a mission- 
ary trip to Sanpete County, from which they return- 
ed on the 19th, having traveled about three hun- 
dred miles and held eighteen meetings. 

R. GILLISPIE AND A. ROBINSON KILLED 
SOUTH OF SAUNA. 

In July, 1865, Anthony Robinson of Monroe, 
Sevier County, went to mill at Manti. He stopped 
at Gunnison on the night of July 12th, with Joshua 
Sylvester ; the night of the 13th he camped near the 
Willow Bend on the west side of the Sevier River; 
some men from Monroe were camping a short dis- 
tance below ; he left his wagon and stayed with them 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 157 



that night. He had a large brindle dog, which growl- 
ed several times during the night, as if something 
was prowling around. Next morning (July 14th) 
he started for home. He soon reached a point im- 
mediately west of the Gravely Ford, where two 
washes come together, the road crossing just below 
them. The Indians had made some small brush piles 
on the low ridge between where the two washes came 
together. There they lay with their gun-barrels 
through the brush piles pointing towards the road 
on the brink of the wash, where they could not be 
observed. When Brother Robinson got within about 
thirty feet of them, they fired, and he fell back on 
his flour dead. One of the oxen was also killed, 
while the other ox broke the yoke in the 
middle and got away; he was found about 
two weeks afterwards in a larke willow patch, 
carrying half of the yoke. The Indians also 
killed the dog. The people of Monroe were waiting 
for Robinson 's return as the town was out of flour. 
When his remains were found it was discovered that 
the Indians had scalped him, that they had taken 
what flour they could carry away and then turned 
the balance out of the sacks over his body. They had 
taken the sacks and all his other things, gun, pistol, 
bedding, etc., away with them. The evening previous 
Jake Harris of Glenwood and Robert Gillispie of 
Mount Pleasant were hunting some horses south of 
Salina. As they were crossing a dry hollow, about 
one half a mile north of Lost Creek, Indians fired 
on them from ambush, shooting Gillispie in the back. 
Harris who was walking, beside him, leading his 
horse, ran to the river close by; he claimed that he 
ran so close by some Indians that he could have 



158 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

touched them, jumped into the river. He crossed 
over and hid in the willows on the west side till 
night; bare headed and with feet bleeding he then 
made his way to Gunnison about 16 miles distant. 
A conference had been appointed at Manti, 
President Young and some of the twelve were ex- 
pected to be there. On the 14th of July a company 
of men from Monroe (then called Alma) and some 
from Eichfield, were on their way to Manti on horse 
back enroute to Conference. Near the Gravely Ford 
where a trail left the road making a cut-off to the 
ford, they took this trail. In doing so they saw Rob- 
inson's wagon up on the road, but thought it was 
some one camping. After crossing the Ford they 
saw, near a large bunch of brush, a man's hat. 
Lorentz Dastrup picked up the hat and handed it to 
Wm. Morrison, after which they rode on, crossing 
Lost Creek and the large wash. There they saw, 
out in an open grassy place, a horse with the saddle 
on feeding, and thought they saw a man lying 
down supposedly resting. They stopped at Salina. 
Some men from Glenwood returning from Sanpete, 
carried the sad news of the killing of Anthony 
Eobinson to Glenwood and then to Richfield and 
Alma, whose people turned out and brought his ef- 
fects and the body of Robinson home. Joseph Mil- 
lett coming from Manti reported at Glenwood and 
A. W. Buchanan and Geo. Pectol took the news to 
Salina. An express party under August Nielsen of 
Richfield also carried the word to Salina, overtak- 
ing Judge Morrison and party, who took the sad 
news to the Manti Conference where Presiden Young 
and party from Salt Lake City were in attendance. 
A number of men were sent back from Salina, and 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 159 

before reaching Lost Creek went out to where the 
saddled horse had been seen feeding, and found Gil- 
lispie lying on his back dead. As they went on, 
they could see the tracks of Gillispie's horse from 
the hollow where the man was shot; the horse had 
been going fast to where the hat was found, about 
three miles distant and it proved to be Gillispie's 
hat. It appeared also that he had turned and gone 
east toward Glenn's Twist, where a road passed 
through to Glenwood and that when he had reached 
this road he had gone back and crossed the hol- 
low where he was shot ; thence he rode out to where 
the body was found. Here he is supposed to have 
dismounted and died there. He was taken to Mount 
Pleasant for burial. 

GEN. W. S. SNOW TOOK COMMAND OF 
SANPETE MILITIA. 

The news of this double murder aroused the 
martial spirit in Sanpete, and Gen'l Warren S. SEOW 
with about one hundred men was soon on the march 
endeavoring to head off the hostiles in the mountains 
towards Fish Lake. Gen. Snow took command of 
the Sanpete militia July 15th. 

GEN. SNOW STARTS AFTER THE INDIANS. THE 

SQUAW FIGHT IN GRASS VALLEY, MARINE YORK 

WOUNDED. 

After arriving at Glenwood they stayed there 
all day on the 17th, and at dusk started over the 
mountain for Grass Valley over a rough trail, Joshua 
W. Sylvester says "At daylight, on the morn- 
ing of the 18th, we had a good view of the whole 



160 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

valley. Descending the mountain, we reached a 
creek, and un-saddled, resting just opposite a large 
cedar grove near the present site of Burrville. The 
picket guard was sent out and returned in a very 
short time. We were aroused and told that the cedars 
were full of Indians. The horses were soon saddled 
and we surrounded the grove. The first shot was 
fired by an Indian who lay behind a fallen log, the 
shot entering the breast of Marine York of Rich- 
field. Captain Beach ordered his men to dismount 
and enter the cedars which was done and the In- 
dians were soon routed. It was part of the band that 
had killed Eobinson, as we found some of his things 
with them ; the main gang had gone on ahead. E. C. 
Petersen (Chris Feuting) says that there were six 
Indian tents below the hill and that Colonel Ivie's 
company were on the outskirts of the grove and did 
not see many Indians; that after the fight some of 
his boys wanted to go back and look for dead In- 
dians and guns, but the Colonel said: "No, let the 
squaws go and hunt up their pappooses. Then Ivie's 
company drew off. While some of the others 
searched the grounds. It was reported soon after 
the fight that only one Indian got away and a doz- 
en or more had been killed, including some squaws 
and pappooses; the militia had fired into a large 
bushy cedar where a lot of them were concealed. It 
was also said that Louis Thompson of Ephraim and 
a man from Casper 's Company came onto a bunch 
of squaws and pappooses, and that they were left 
there to guard them. One of the squaws tried to 
get away, and when prevented by Thompson, she 
picked up a stick of wood and struck him with it ; he 
then shot her. This excited the others and they were

soon dispatched. This event has been dubbed "the 
squaw fight." Mr. Sylvester continues: We re- 
turned through the head of Grass Valley, down Sa- 
lina Canyon to Salina, where we stayed a couple of 
days jerking beef and getting provisions ready for 
a trip into the mountains. 

SEN. SNOW AND COMMAND START FO 
GREEN RIVER. 

On the evening of the 20th we started 
out again, and when about half a mile from 
town a sad accident happened; as we stopped 
by a large boulder to gird our saddles, Jack Harper 
set his gun (a Joslin) down against a rock and in 
some way discharged it, the ball passing through the 
cheek of the horse which James Mortensen 
was riding and lodged under Mortensen 's col- 
lar bone; he still (1917) carries that ball and another 
with which he was shot later. The company stopped 
there while some of the boys took him back to Salina. 
After dark the company traveled to Twelve Mile 
Creek (now Mayfield) and camped for the night. 
The next day we went up Twelve Mile Canyon, cros- 
sed the mountain south of the "Nipple" and came out 
at the head of Salina Canyon where we camped the 
next night. Next day we traveled up Convulution 
Canyon and kept going till late at night ; it was moon- 
light, but the sky was full of floating clouds. A 
short distance down the canyon was a pond of water, 
and when the moon shone out on the water it look- 
ed like fires being replenished at intervals with 
brush. The country being very rough. The men 
thinking it was an Indian camp stood and held their 



162 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

horses all night, intending to surround the camp and 
make an attack at daybreak; but in the morning we 
found out our mistake and traveled down the val- 
ley where we struck the Indians' trail; they were 
driving a herd of cattle toward Green River. We fol- 
lowed, traveling day and night un'..l we reached 
Price River where we met Colonel Reddick N. All- 
red's command. Colonel Allred says in his journal: 
1 1 1 crossed the mountains with eighty men. We found 
three or four lodges of Tabby's Indians returning 
from a hunt, and the boys wanted to kill them, but 
I restrained them because they had their families 
with them. We formed a junction with General 
Snow's men on Price River and went to Green River 
without seeing the marauders. Returning we tra- 
veled by way of Cottonwood Creek and Huntmgton 
Creek and crossed the mountains on the rocky trail 
to Manti." 

Mr. Sylvester continues his narrative as follows : 
After meeting Colonel Allred 's Command it was de- 
cided to follow the trail farther. We took an inven- 
tory of our provisions and found that there was a 
pint of cracker crumbs to each man for three days. 
Two days travel brought us to Green River where 
we remained one day. Some of the boys swam the 
river and found tracks which looked as fresh as if 
they had been made that morning. Most of the boys 
wanted to follow the trail (tracks) but the officers 
decided that on account of jaded horses and being out 
of supplies we had better give up the chase, which, 
from what we learned afterwards, was a lucky thing 
for us. Thomas Caldwell, one of the company, who 
in after years talked with Chief Jake Arropeen, 
was told by that chief that he saw him (Cald- 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 163 

well) come to the river to get water, and could have 
shot him. Caldwell asked: " Why didn't you." The 
chief answered that he did not want to ; he also 
said that the Indians could have shot the men who 
swam the river. ' ' Why didn 't you shoot them, ' ' ask- 
ed Caldwell. Arropeen replied that they wanted all 
the men to get into the river first, then the water 
would have been red. He said the Indians were am- 
bushed, and as soon as the white men had got into 
the stream they were going to open fire. We started 
back the next morning, traveling two days and night 
without food. On the third day we were so nearly 
starved that the men wanted to kill a horse. The 
officers told them that if they did not meet supplies 
that day we might kill an animal. 

But that evening we met the men with the packs 
of supplies at the mouth of Eock Canyon; we tore 
the sacks open and filled our pockets and shirt bos- 
oms with biscuits and started up the trail ; we could 
only go single file till we reached the top of the ridge 
or mountain. 

The next day we all took our different routes for 
our homes from the top of the mountain. Our boys 
reached Grunnison at one o 'clock in the morning sing- 
ing, "We will rally round the flag, boys." 

ATTACK ON GLENWOOD, MERRITT 
STALY WOUNDED. 

At daybreak, on July 26, 1865, Merritt Staley, a 
blacksmith at Glen wood, went out after coal to start 
a fire in his shop. As he raised up with a basket 
of coal he was fired upon by Indians who lay con- 
cealed under the creek bank ; one bullet went through 



164 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



his right breast, one seared his lip under his nose, and 
still another grazed his forehead. He placed his hat 
over his breast where he was shot and shouted "Help 
murder, ' ' and partly fell down the steps into the dug- 
out where he and his family lived. Glenwood ha<J 
only been settled the previous year and only a very 
few houses had as yet been built. Staley's wife got 
out of bed and ran down to the house of Peter Allen, 
who lived across the block, and gave the alarm, say- 
ing that her husband had been shot, and that her two 
little girls were in bed and would surely be killed. 
Isaac Allen, a mere boy, grabbed a gun and ran up 
through the lot into the dugout. He seized the two 
little girls, one in each arm, and ran with them, the 
bullets flying all around him. 

At the first shot, Solomon Case, who lived just 
across the road cried out "Indians," he got his gun 
from above the door, and opened the door to look out, 
when Thomas Goff, his step-son, fourteen years old, 
went outside in time to see Staley fall, as he sup- 
posed, into the cellar, and also to see his wife run 
down to Aliens. An Indian called out, "Sol Case, 
shoot him" when a volley from the Indians on the hill 
was fired at the boy Goff, bullets hitting all around 
him. The boy ran back into the house, opened the 
back or west door which had no hinges, but was held 
in place with pegs, laid it down on the floor, ran out 
and down to main street, where he met some men, 
who saw an Indian on the hill squat down and shoot 
at some one. Mrs. Case was in bed with a baby girl 
two days old, and the nurse (Mrs. Charlotte Beal) 
picked up the baby and ran down through a patch of 
corn. Mrs. Case said to her husband "If you don't 
take me down town I will get up and run." Mr. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 165 

Case wrapped a quilt round her, and with the cor- 
ners over his shoulders carried her on his back down 
to the main part of the town. 

The Indians kept up a constant fire from the 
rocks on the hill and some of the brethren went up 
near the hill and took shelter behind a house. 

Bishop Wareham who had a Sharp's rifle, re- 
marked : ' * there sits a beggar on a rock, ' ' and hand- 
ed his gun to George Pectol, who crawled out to 
a wagon box, took rest and fired ; at the crack of the 
gun the Indian fell backwards off the rock. Another 
Indian said later that the shot fired by Pectol took 
the Indian's jaw off. 

The people at Glenwood started a man with an 
express for Salina, but he was headed off a short dis- 
tance north of town. Then Samuel Short was sent to 
Richfield and got through. When returning a com- 
pany of men went with him to Glenwood. 

In Eichfield the drum beat about nine o'clock 
a. m. Those out on picket duty came in, and as they 
had their guns, they were ordered to get horses as 
quickly as possible and go to Salina, as the Indians 
w r ere moving in that direction. Peter Gottfredson, 
one of them writes : There were ten of us and we 
were ordered to get through, if we had to fight our 
way. When at Cedar Ridge some Indians were seen 
on the east side of the river moving north, and when 
nearing the Willow Bend, Indians were seen passing 
a bunch of brush going toward the river ; the road at 
this place passed along the river bank on the west 
side. No doubt, if we had followed the road, we 
would have been shot at but we circled up toward the 
west mountains, out of gun reach and came back into 
the road about a half mile north of the bend. There

a consultation was held, in which it was decided that 
it was not safe for us to cross the river at the regu- 
lar ford. Consequently a cattle ford was chosen. 
When we got to town, we learned that most of the 
men had gone to Manti to mill, but was expected 
home the next day. 

We all stood guard that night. The next day 
about ten o'clock the Salina men came home; they 
had camped at Willow Creek, distant about eight 
miles, during the night. Soon after, five of us start- 
ed home. When within about three miles of Rich- 
field we scattered out hunting rabbits. Some one 
outside of town saw us and reported that the Indians 
were coming; he knew that it was Indians, for one 
had on a red blanket. I had on a big red flannel 
shirt which I wore instead of a coat. The drum beat 
and all the people gathered at the meeting house. 
When we got to town and saw no one, we wondered 
what was wrong, but when we got to the public square 
we saw the people at the meeting house, and when 
things were explained it was learned that we were 
the Indians that had been seen. Many of the men 
with the best guns were out in pursuit of real Indians 
who had driven away a lot of stock. 

MINUTE COMPANIES ORDERED AWAY 
FROM HOME. 

About this time it was decided to send the min- 
ute companies away from their homes to guard the 
trails and mountain passes. About the 28th of July, 
Captain Niels L. Christensen with a company of men 
from Richfield and Captain Isaac M. Allred with a 
company from Spring City were stationed at Fort

Gunnison to guard the trails between Salina and 
Twelve Mile Creek ; they were ordered out for sixty 
days. While there, nothing of special importance 
happened, but one evening the cowherders came in 
without the herd and reported that the Indians were 
over the Sevier river gathering up the stock. We 
were soon in the saddle and over the river. The 
night being dark, we hunted for some time but final- 
ly found the herd lying down in a bend of the river 
and brought the animals to town. 

The Gunnison boys were stationed up the Sevier 
river, in the neighborhood of Glenwood. At the end 
of fifty days we were all allowed to go home. 

BATTLE AT RED LAKE, SNOW, TAYLOR 
AND FRANSEN WOUNDED. 

Nearly two months had passed since there had 
been any serious outbreak. But Indians were prowl- 
ing round Circleville, and it was reported that they 
had a rendezvous somewhere near Fish Lake, east of 
Sevier Valley. 

General Warren S. Snow with 103 men went up 
the Eiver as far as Circleville ; he had with him Col- 
onel John Ivie's company of cavalry from Mount 
Pleasant, and Captain N. S. Beache 's company from 
Manti, with some recruits from other companies; 
they went to investigate the condition of affairs and 
arrived in Circleville September 18, 1865. On the 19 
they marched up the east fork of the Sevier to Clover 
Flat, where they encamped for the night. There they 
got onto the Indian's trail, which they follwed over 
the plateau between Grass and Eabbit Valleys. Night 
overtook them before reaching the latter valley; it

was raining and very dark; they made camp in the 
head of a very rough canyon. Early next morning 
(September 21st) Ezra Shoemaker and another man 
went out to reconnoiter; they found the track of a 
pony which had come within half a mile of camp and 
turned back ; they reported what they had seen. The 
company then worked their way down the canyon. 
When they reached the flat country, at a small lake 
or pond called Bed Lake, near Thousand Lake Moun- 
tain, they made a halt. General Snow and Col. Ivie 
went up a black, rock ridge to ge t a view of the coun- 
try and its surroundings. When near the top, Col. 
Ivie saw a ramrod wiggling behind a brush only a few 
paces away, and exclaimed " There they are," when 
a volley was fired from ambush, one bullet hitting 
and seriously wounding General Snow in the 
shoulder. 

The men retreated to the company, when a gen- 
eral battle ensued; the Indians firing from ambush 
on top of the hill. The Indians over-shot the bil- 
lets singing over the heads of the soldiers, striking in 
the water, fairly making it boil. Orson Taylor of 
Richfield received a serious gun-shot wound in the 
side. George Frandsen of Mount Pleasant, while 
concealed in a gully, trying to get a shot at an In- 
dian he had seen, received a bullet high in the fore- 
head, the missle plowing through his hair and fill- 
ing his eyes arid face with blood, but it caused no fur- 
ther injury. A short retreat was ordered for the pur- 
pose of getting flanking movements on the savages, 
when it was noticed that one o.f the pack animals had 
been left behind. Ezra Shoemaker of Manti and an- 
other man went back, and in the midst of a shower of 
bullets from the enemy recovered the animal with 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 169 

the pack. The fighting continued till night and sev- 
eral Indians were killed. The militia crossed back 
over the mountain in the night to Grass Valley and 
made camp. Next day they marched down King's 
Meadow Canyon to Glendwood, where they separated 
and returned to their respective homes. 

ATTACK ON EPHRAIM, SEVEN SETTLERS 
KILLED, TWO WOUNDED. 

Contributed by N. 0. Anderson. 

On the 17th of October, 1865, early in the morn- 
ing, Peter Larsen came to me and asked me to go with 
him into the canyon, saying that it would be safe be- 
cause a number of men had gone up ; so we went up 
together. We had proceeded up the canyon a dis- 
tance of about five miles to the forks ot the three 
roads, above the long bridge, when we saw a man 
coming down the road on the run; it was Henry 
Green, who told us to turn back, that the Indians 
were up above in the canyon and from their ambush 
had killed some of the boys belonging to a company 
of six. Benjamin Black, Peter Graves, Thomas Wol- 
sey, Wm. T. Hite and two others constituted the com- 
pany. The place where they stopped to get their 
loads was one fourth of a mile east of the lake on 
Lake Hill. Peter Graves in running west came 
on to an Indian in the brush who had fired his gun 
and had not had time to re-load. Graves passed the 
Indian and ran down Maple creek, followed by two 
other Indians nearly all day. He had a dog with him 
and when hiding in the brush had to hold the dog's 
mouth to keep him from barking and revealing his 
whereabouts. He ran across Birch Creek and onto 



170 INDIAN DEPBBDATIONS 

the bald mountain where the Indian fired at him and 
then turned back. He got home after dark. Wolsey 
ran east and warned Louis Larsen and Rasmus 
Jensen who then ran north and down the north side 
of the canyon, being in sight of the Indians all the 
time. Wm. T. Hite also ran down the canyon and 
got on the dugway; he was killed on the so-called 
Wire Grass Flat. 

Down on the same road where the men were 
killed known as the Black Stump Road, some men 
were at work getting out timber, namely, Peter Isaac- 
sen, James C. Jensen and Ole C. Jensen; they ran 
north and joined Louis Larsen and Thomas Wol- 
sey; they all reached home safely. Among the men 
killed was Soren N. Jespersen, 50 years old. It ap- 
peared that he had been fearfully tortured while yet 
alive. Being quite deaf, he did not hear the boys 
when they called to him. The Indians came upon 
him unawares and got between him and his wagon 
where he had left his gun. Thus he was at their 
mercy. When Peter Larsen and I met Henry Green, 
we turned back and went down about a fourth of a 
mile to the Black Spring; had we arrived there one 
minute later we would have been cut off. The In- 
dians came into the road a few rods behind us, but 
we dodged behind a hill and went down the creek 
road. The Indians went down the dugway and tried 
to head us off, but they came in behind us and did not 
see us. They went up the way we came down, expect- 
ing to meet us. We had then ran about two miles and 
continued on to the grist mill where my partners 
stopped. I continued on into town and gave the 
alarm. Arming myself with a gun I went back to 
the mill. The Indians were then out of the canyon, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 171 

making for the fields ; a few of us got together and 
started down also. We saw some teams coming on 
the road from Manti and Indians directing their 
course towards them. With these teams was my 
brother-in-law Andrew H. Whitlock, who was driv- 
ng a carriage slowly toward Ephraim. He had in 
the rig an old doctor-Lady, Mrs. Snow of Manti 
and L. C. Larsen. Mrs. Snow, on noticing the ap- 
proach of the Indians, said, "The Indians are going 
to hurt you. ' ' Whitlock replied that he thought the 
Indians had made peace and therefore he did not in- 
crease his speed. Some Indians crossed the road 
about seventy-five yards in front of them and 
stopped. Whitlock now whipped up the horses, but 
the Indians fired as they passed, one bullet from 
their volley hitting one of the horses in the flank; 
it ranged forward, but the horse kept up his speed 
till he got into Charles Whitlock 's yard in the center 
of town, where he fell dead. 

While running, L. C. Larsen got down on the 
double-trees and lay low, while Whitlock stayed in 
the seat. Chief Yenewoods who was well known by 
the white people, rode along beside the carriage 
shooting at the people till he emptied his revolver, 
but did not hit any of them. With his bow, however, 
he shot an arrow into Whitlock 's back and then left. 
Larsen got up from the wagon tongue and pulled the 
arrow out of Whitlock 's back. Brother Whitlock 
suffered all the rest of his life from that wound. 

The Indians then rode into the field west of 
the town and killed Martin P. Kuhre, about 28 years 
old, and wife, Hansine Kristine, 28 years old, and 
Elizabeth Petersen, a grown girl, 17 years old. 



172 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



Soren A. Sorensen was near by when Kuhre 
fell. The Indian chief Black-Hawk rode towards 
him. Sorensen states that when he met Black-Hawk 
he walked up to him and rested his hand on the horn 
of the Chief's saddle. Black-Hawk told Sorensen 
that he was going to get some cattle. While in con- 
versation with the chief other Indians killed Kuhre 
within thirty feet of them, and his wife not more 
than fifty yards distant. Kuhre fell with his t\vo 
year old son in his arms; the little boy made his 
way to his dead mother where he was picked up by 
Morten Benson and carried to town by John F. F. 
Dorius. N. 0. Anderson, who has given most of this 
information, asked Sorensen how he could account 
for the kindness of the Indian chief towards him. 
Sorensen answered ' ' I cannot say why, unless it was 
owing to the fact that when I was home with my par- 
ents, my mother took a liking to the young Indian 
Black Hawk; and when he came to our house, she 
would frequently invite him to eat with us, and 
would give him almost anything he asked for. The In- 
dians did not take Sorensen 's team, but gathered up 
what stock they wanted, about two hundred head, 
and went back the way they came. They left some of 
their number stationed all the way from where they 
started with the cattle and up the canypn. When 
the Indians crossed the county road with the stock, 
Louis Larsen and William Thorp came along and 
asked me to go with them. We followed along 
behind, while other citizens were scattered along 
the road toward the mill, a distance of about a mile. 
When we got up above the guard knoll known as the 
Big Rocks, the Indians made a stand, and we had a 
battle with them which lasted several hours. Wil- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 173 



liam Thorp was killed and Louis Larsen was wound- 
ed in the leg. This ended that day's tragedy; seven 
persons had been killed and about two hundred head 
of stock driven off. 

I have written this according to the best of my 
recollection, I have also consulted those living who 
were in the most dangerous places and took part 
in the affairs." 

The following was reported by Charles Whit- 
lock and corrected by Ezra Shoemaker : 

On Saturday, Oct. 18th, a small body of men 
from Manti and Ephraim went up the canyon after 
the bodies of those who had been killed by Indians 
the day previous. They brought he body of Ben- 
jamin Black down to where Soren Jespersen lay. 
The remains of the latter were found about a rod 
from his wagon ; his hands and feet were chopped off 
and also the upper part of his head. The rescuing 
party placed the bodies of the two men on a two- 
wheeled logging cart. They all went down the can- 
yon, pulling the cart by hand. When they got down 
some distance, they saw some horse-men and think- 
ing they were Indians it caused some excitement. 
The parties seen proved to be men from Ephraim 
who had come up to assist in bringing the bodies 
down. The two parties met on the Wire-Grass Flat 
where they picked up the body of Wm. T. Hite and 
brought the three bodies down to town. 

The seven persons killed were buried in the old 
cemetery north of Ephraim. 

The following statement of L. C. Larson of May- 
field was written to Niels 0. Anderson of Ephraim, 
Utah, about 1916.

I was on my way from Circleville, Piute County, 
Utah, loaded with grain and headed for Salt Lake 
City to purchase fire-arms and ammunition. At 
Manti I met Andrew Whitlock who was there from 
Ephraim for a doctor lady, Maria Snow. As I had 
not been at Ephraim for about two years and had 
not met our comrade Mr. Whitlock before during 
this period, he asked me to ride with him from Manti 
to Ephraim and have Louis Thompson drive my 
team, to which I consented. 

On stepping into Whitlock 's rig, I informed 
Thompson that there was a gun and pistol placed 
under the quilt in the wagon. These I carried with 
me because several people had been killed by In- 
dians during the summer, south and north. 

We first saw the Indians when we were approxi- 
mately two and a half miles south of Ephraim ; they 
were first seen by us east of the road, south of the 
so-called guard knoll. At first sight we mistook them 
for some of the boys out scouting, but all at once they 
made a dash towards us at full speed. Upon reach- 
ing the old Willow Creek Ditch they leaped it with- 
out checking, where-upon I made the remark : l ' They 
are Indians and are riding very recklessly/' Whit- 
lock, (familiarly known as Cap,) answered, that he 
thought perhaps it was the Chief Sanpitch bringing 
the Indians down to make peace, as that had been 
talked of. Lady Snow speaking in the Danish lang- 
uage remarked that they were going to hurt us, but 
Whitlock replied : ' ' If we try to run, they will head 
us off. ' ' The Indians crossed the road about seven- 
ty-five yards ahead of us and about thirteen of them 
formed a quarter circle about thirty yards from the 
road on the west. As we were passing them they 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 175 

leveled their guns on us and fired. They wounded 
one of the horses which died as soon as we stopped at 
Chas. Whitlock's place at Ephraim. As soon as 
they leveled their guns on us, Lady Snow placed 
her head in her lap, which position she held until 
we reached town. Our team was a pair of trained 
racing horses, and as soon as the Indians raised their 
guns on us the teams was on full speed. Chief Yene- 
woods was the only one who overtook us, he was 
on the left (West) side of the road and leveled his 
pistol on me within three feet or less, where upon I 
leaped over the dash-board onto the tongue where 
I sat for a distance of a mile or more, during which 
he emptied his pistol at us and also shot several ar- 
rows at us, none of which took effect, until we reach- 
ed a swale with a ditch in the bottom where the team 
slacked speed. Then an arrow took effect under 
Whitlock's left shoulder on a slant toward the back, 
six inches deep. On hearing him groan, I jumped 
back into the seat and took the lines and whip saying, 
"You are hit with an arrow; shall I pull it out." 
He answered, "Yes, if you can." I did so, when 
we had reached a point where Soren Sorensen now 
lives at Ephraim. The swale referred to is the one 
in Peter Graves 's land, where the old county road 
used to be. On account of the excitement I can not 
remember if the arrow was hard to pull out of his 
shoulder. However, I got it out, but Brother Whit- 
lock still feels the effect of the wound, so he informed 
me the last time I saw him. 

The Indians followed us to the center of the 
block north of Niels Thompson's present home, 
where they turned west into the field and killed 
Morten Pedersen Kuhre, his wife and sister in law, 



176 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

leaving a small boy, less than three years old. This 
child was found crawling on his dead mother. Leav- 
ing this place the Indians went still farther west in- 
to the field, driving off the Ephraim cow-herd and 
several horses, after which they made their way back 
to the hills south of town. 

RAID ON CIRCLEVILLE, FOUR PERSONS 
KILLED. 

Indians made a raid on Circleville, Piute County 
November 26, 1865, killing four persons and drove 
off most of the stock belonging to Circleville. 

Mrs. Mads Nielsen of Spring City wrote the fol- 
lowing graphic account of this raid and of what be- 
fell her and her husband. "On the morning 
of the 26th of November 1865, my husband, Mads 
Nielsen and I left Marysvale for Circleville our 
home, returning from a visit to Salt Lake City. When 
within ten miles of home we passed another team 
which was driven by my Brother-in-Law, James 
Monsen. Being so near home we thought there would 
be no danger of Indians. When we reached a point 
about three miles from town and was driving around 
a hill, we saw a herd of cattle being driven toward 
the mouth of the canyon. I became very much 
frightened, believing it was Indians, and I begged 
my husband to turn back. But as he thought the 
Indians had already seen us, he suggested that by 
driving fast we might reach a company of men who 
were in pursuit of the Indians. In a few minutes the 
Indians left the stock and with a yell started towards 
us. Our horses were very tired, but we urged them 
on, thinking we might reach a swamp about three- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 177 

fourths of a mile ahead, but in this we did not suc- 
ceed. The Indians rode up to us, and one of them 
was in the act of shooting my husband, who, however, 
frightened him away some distance by pointing an 
old revolver at him. I suppose I am now safe in tell- 
ing that the revolver was an old broken one, but of 
course, we did not tell the Indian so. Mr. Redskin 
now turned and shot our best horse, which of course 
stopped the team. At the request of my husband, I 
with my two year old brother in my arms, jumped 
from the wagon, while the Indian was reloading his 
gun. Willows were growing along the road, but as 
they were low they did not afford much protection. 
The Indian again mounted his horse and rode around 
trying to get a chance to shoot my husband. At 
this juncture I jumped into a slough that was near, 
in which the water reached up to my neck, but I pre- 
ferred drowning to being captured by the Indians. 
My husband again pointed the revolver at the In- 
dian who again turned back. My husband then took 
my little brother whom I was holding up out of the 
water and I climbed out of the slough. We walked a 
short distance and tried to cross the swamp at an- 
other point, but were headed off by ten Indians. 
Hence we got into the water again. The little boy 
began to cry because the water was so cold, and we 
left the slough once more. I sat down behind a 
bunch of willows taking the little boy in my lap, and 
my husband stood over us to give what protection 
he could. The Indians did not follow us into the 
the willows, but turned their attention to the wagon 
and its belongings. They cut the harness from the 
wounded horse, leaving the collar, and took the 
wagon cover off. They emptied the flour on the 



178 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

ground, cut the feather bed tick and scattered all the 
feathers, threw all the dishes out of the wagon, 
breaking all but one plate which I still have. They 
also took all of our clothing. While they were de- 
stroying the contents of the wagon, an old man 
named Froid, who had traveled in our company, 
arrived at the top of the hill and saw the Indians. He 
might have escaped all right if he had gone back him- 
self at once, but he ran around his steers to drive 
them back. The Indians saw him, and followed him 
into the hills about a mile and killed him. 

Just before my sister and her husband reached 
the ridge they were met by two men who had been 
sent out to guard the cattle. These men said that 
while they were sitting in a bunch of willows eating 
their dinner the Indians came out of the canyon and 
held a council close to them. One of the men had a 
dog with him, and he sat and held its mouth to pre- 
vent him from making a noise, and thus they escaped 
being discovered. These men informed my brother- 
in-law that the Indians had made a raid on the set- 
tlement. As they traveled on through the hills, my 
sister and her husband found the body of the old 
gentleman Froid, whom the Indians had killed. 
When they reached the top of the hill they could 
see our wagon, and the wounded horse lying by it; 
they thought we had been killed. We being hid in the 
willows could not hear my sister crying. My husband 
crawled out to a point where he could see them. And 
as he saw four persons he thought the two men were 
Indians and we dared not go to them. It was now 
getting dark and we had remained in the willows 
since two o'clock in the afternoon. We got out of 
the willows and started for the settlement without

following the wagon road. We reached our home 
about an hour after my sister and her husband ar- 
rived. 

It was late in the evening; we were both bare- 
headed and my clothes were frozen stiff on my body. 
My little brother had gone to sleep. 

When we entered the house it was full of peo- 
ple who had gathered because it had been reported 
that we had been killed. 

It is needless to say that our meeting was a 
happy one. 

Mads Nielsen died in Spring City, March 9th 
1899." -Ellen A. Nielsen 

Sent to P. Gottfredson, April 15th, 1907. 

At the time when the Indians took the stock at 
Circleville they killed Hans Christian Hansen, who 
was about a mile or more east of town with the stock, 
and Orson Barney and Ole Heilersen, two boys thir- 
teen years old, who were out searching for cows. 

DR. J. M. WHITMORE AND R. McINTYRE KILLED 
AT PIPE SPRINGS. BODIES OF WHITMORE 

AND McINTYRE FOUND. 
SEVEN INDIANS KILLED. 

According to a statement of David Chidester 
of Venice, Utah: 

Early in the year 1866 the Navajo Indians who 
were on the Arizona side of the Colorado River, be- 
ing more numerous and superior than the Shevete 
Indians who inhabited the Utah side of the river, 
would often cross over and compel the less powerful 
tribe to do their bidding. Frequently they also 
oaptured and made slaves of some of them. On this 



180 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



IIIIIIIMIIII 



certain occasion some of them crossed over and com- 
pelled the Shevete's who were camped in the neigh- 
borhood to assist in killing Dr. J. M. Whitmore and 
his hired man, Robert Mclntyre, and drive away 
their sheep-herd and some cattle. This took place 
in the beginning of a big snow storm. When Dr. 
Whitmore and his hired man left the herd-house 
Whitmore had on his overcoat and carried in his 
pocket two twenty dollar gold pieces. The Shevete 
Indians secured the men's clothing, but not knowing 
the value of money, the gold pieces were later re- 
covered. The Navajoes took the sheep and cattle 
over the river and they were never recovered. About 
the 20th of January, 1866, a company of armed men 
from St. George went in search of the murdered men. 
They came across two young Indians and compelled 
them to assist in the hunt. They acknowledged hav- 
ing seen the killing, but claimed they had no hand in 
it. There was about eighteen inches of crusted snow 
on the ground and the bodies were covered up. The 
men rode forward and back, four abreast and fin- 
ally Colonel Pierce 's horse stepped over the body of 
Dr. Whitmore and uncovered one hand which was 
raised above the body. When the whites informed 
the Indians that one of the murdered men had been 
found, one asked if it was the man with whiskers. 
When answered in the affirmative, he said : the other 
is over this way, they followed the Indian and then 
found Mclntyre 's body. There was a camp of In- 
dians not far distant and Captain Pierce, with some 
of his men, went there and found the murdered 
men's clothing. The Indians refused to be taken 
prisoners and put up a fight, which resulted in seven 
of them being killed.

GENERAL SNOW ARRESTS A GAMP OF 
INDIANS AT NEPHI. 

On Monday, March 12th, 1866, General Warren 
S. Snow of Manti arrested some Indians at a camp 
a couple of miles northeast of Nephi, in Juab County. 
One Indian who tried to escape, was shot down; 
four others were tried in court and by order of the 
chief was taken out of town and shot for complicity 
in several raids. Eight others, including Chief San- 
pitch, were taken to Manti and placed in jail. Early 
in April the ecclesiastical and military authorities 
of some of the settlements of southern Utah asked 
for assistance from neighboring counties. One of 
the first to respond was Iron County, which sent 
twenty-four men with teams to help build a fort on 
the Sevier Eiver for the protection of the set Hers. 
General Daniel H. Wells recognized in the move- 
ments of the hostiles the indications of a disastrous 
war and at once ordered all the available men of the 
three counties, Sanpete, Sevier and Piute to be mus- 
tered into service as cavalry and infantry and or- 
ganized for defense. But no vigilance was equal to 
the task of defeating the designs of the sleepless foe, 
the strength of whose forces was now increased to 
over three hundred warriors, and the celerity of 
whose movements defied every precaution.

County, their former home, to Long Valley, April 2, 
1866. When at Ezra Strong's place, called the 
Troughs, in Kane County, they were asked to stay 
a few days, while the ranch people gathered up their 
stock, getting ready to leave they would go with the 
Berrys to Long Valley, but as they were in a hurry 
they did not stop. 

Arriving at Short Creek, William Maxwell and 
family who lived there, advised them to stop, as they 
were also gathering their effects, and they would all 
go in together. The Berry's declined and went on, 
their team consisting of a good pair of horses and a 
light wagon. They also had a plow and a few farm 
implements with them, and such supplies as they 
would need at their new home. When at the Cedar 
Ridge, two or three miles from Short Creek, they 
were attacked by Indians from the cedars and killed. 
When the bodies were subsequently found it appear- 
ed that Joseph Berry had been wounded in the leg, as 
a towel was wrapped around it. the travelers had un- 
doubtedly turned and driven back towards Short 
Creek, and had gone as far as the Big Sand Wash, 
where they were again attacked. It also appeared 
that one of the horses had been shot in the shoulder 
with an arrow, as the collar was found with an arrow 
point sticking through it about an inch and a half, 
which crippled the horse so that he was unable to 
pull; the other horse had cramped the wagon and 
there they had all been killed and their horses taken 
by the savages. 

When found, Robert Berry was tied to the front 
wheel of the wagon with his face out, and was shot 
full of holes ; Joseph was found a short distance from 
the wagon. Robert Berry's wife lay across the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 183 

wagon tongue face up and stripped; she had been 
outraged and horribly mutilated. The people from 
the troughs and Short Creek passed with their 
sheep, cattle and effects, without seeing them or their 
wagon, as they were some distance from the wagon 
road. When they arrived at Long Valley, they in- 
quired as to when the Berry's got there, and were 
informed that they were not there. The two brothers 
with some others from Long Valley then went in 
search of them; when they found the wagon and 
place where they had been killed, the bodies were 
not there. They were murdered below Maxwell's 
ranch and Berryville. Each had two pistols. They 
also had a double barrel shot-gun. Some men who 
had been hunting stock had found them and taken 
them to Graf ton and buried them there ; consequent- 
ly the brothers did not get to see them. 

About two weeks later a number of men from 
St. George and vicinity under Colonel J. D. L. Pierce 
went to Long Valley to assist in moving the people 
out. When they moved there were from one to three 
families to each wagon. One Indian was found dead 
near the place where the Berry s had been killed ; it 
appeared to be an old Indian judging from the long 
gray hair shown to the people as they passed. 

REMOVAL FROM LONG VALLEY, REPORT 
BY MRS. J. D. L. PIERCE. 

In the spring of 1866, Brother Erastus Snow 
called a council of his officers and men, to arrange 
for calling the outside people in, as the Navajoes had 
become very troublesome. Brother Snow said to 
Brother Pierce, "Brother John, if you will select a 



184 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



man to take command, you may stay at home this 
trip and put in your crops, as you have had such a 
strenuous winter. ' ' Brother Branch was chosen for 
the position and he selected Elroy Barney, Tom 
Pierce, Jesse Crosby and several others to go with 
him. I think about twelve men altogether the best 
young men in the country. They were to start from 
the public square in St. George. Father went down 
to see them off. Brother Snow of course was there 
to see that all was to his liking ; he did not seem satis- 
fied and said to father, ' l Brother John, this is going 
to be a very critical trip and you have to move the 
people out of Long Valley; I had much rather you 
would go, and I want you to bring the women and 
children, whether the men come or not. ' ' Father, an- 
swering, said: "All right, but I have no horse." 
Brother Branch got off his horse and turned it over 
to father who wrote a note to me, saying ' ' I must go 
and do my duty, you do the best you can, and God 
bless you." With this he was gone. He had no 
trouble, however, in getting the men out of Long 
Valley as they were glad to have help. There were 
about twenty wagons, and some cattle and horses. 
They had a very serious trip, however, one small boy 
was run over and killed, and they had to stop and 
bury him ; one babe was born on the journey. They 
traveled at night to avoid the Indians. In coining 
down a long, hard canyon, father stationed a part of 
them at the back of the outfit, himself and the rest 
in advance, always on the alert. Father's keen ear 
heard the chirrup of a bird. He suspicioned Indians 
and shouted for him to come out of the brush, or he 
would shoot. Mr. Indian came out with a piece of 
paper, saying, it was a letter. Father told him to call 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 185 

Illlllllllllllllltllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllt 

to Ms friends and tell them to go away, or he would 
shoot him without any further talk; one other In- 
dian came out. They seized both of them, tied their 
hands behind them and marched them in front of 
the company until morning, when they had reached 
a good road in an open country. They then bound 
the Indians over to keep the peace and turned them 
loose. These Indians were two of the meanest sav- 
ages in that country at the time ; the rest of the trip 
was uneventful. 

On receiving the report of the trip Brother Snow 
he was pretty well acquainted with Indian history, 
but that move out of Long Valley was the best plann- 
ed, and showed the best generalship of any he had 
heard of. ". 

RAID ON SALINA, THREE TEAMS ATTACKED, 

COW HERD TAKEN, HERDER 

KILLED. 

Black Hawk with thirty mounted iollowers in- 
tercepted three teams from Glenwood Sevier Coun- 
ty, April 13, 1866, about a mile north of Salina, on 
their way to the States after emigrants. They were 
Seth Wareham, Joseph Herring and John Wasden ; 
The teamsters escaped and got to Salina, but their 
teams, consisting of nine yoke of oxen, were taken by 
the Indians and the things in their wagons either 
carried away or demolished. 

A sheep herder from Fairview, Sanpece County 
named Johnson was killed in the foot hills northeast 
of Salina town. Emil Nielsen of Salina says, "I was 
helping to herd the Salina cow-herd while the men 
were employed building a fort. We were on the west 



186 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



side of the Sevier Eiver northwest of town distant 
about two miles, near the old wagon Ford. My bro- 
ther, older than I, was with me. We had been talking 
about Indians and he said that if the Indians came 
after him he would run and jump into the river. We 
saw the Indians on the east side of the river, but did 
not know they were Indians ; they had attacked the 
three teams from Glenwood just before X e saw 
them. They came over the river after the cow-herd. 
When we saw the Indians coming, Chris, my brother, 
ran to the river and was evidently killed there in the 
river as he was never found, but one foot with the 
shoe on was found down the river during the sum- 
mer. An Indian came after me and shot at me with 
arrows; the first arrow hit my right arm, and the 
next went into my left side. I was running and fell. 
The Indian then took off my hat and shot an arrow 
into my head and pulled it out three times. I thought 
if I could make the Indians think I was dead, he 
might leave me, and as I did not flinch when he shot 
me in the head, he evidently left me for dead. I lay 
there from about ten o 'clock in the morning till near 
sundown. I dared not get up, fearing that the In- 
dians might be near and see me and come and finish 
me. When I got up, I went to look for my brother, 
but could not find him. I then waded the river, the 
water being above my waist, and I started for home. 
On the way I met a man by the name of Hans en, and 
when I reached the edge of town, I met my father, 
who picked me up and carried me home. I carried 
the arrow spike in my side for two weeks before it 
could be taken out. The old doctor lady, Maria Snow, 
of Manti, put poultices on the wounds and it drew out 
the spike. I was eleven years old. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 187 



The Indians on that occasion got away with two 
hundred head of stock. 

Emil Nielsen was a respected citizen of Salina 
Utah, till December 1917, when he died at Salina. 

INDIANS AT MANTI BROKE JAIL, THREE 
INDIANS KILLED, FIVE ESCAPE. 

Chief Sanpitch, who had been so reluctant to 
sign the treaty drawn up and presented to his fellow 
chieftains at Spanish Fork on June 8th of the pre- 
vious year, 1865, was quick to violate his pledge 
when opportunity offered and when Black Hawk's 
successes proved sufficient to seduce him from his al- 
legiance, he joined in some of the depredations plan- 
ned by the renegade chiefs, though not with the 
latter 's good fortune for he was one of those taken 
prisoner at Nephi on April 12th. Sanpitch and the 
other Indian prisoners at Manti broke jail, April 
14, 1866. From Wm. A. Cox of Manti we learn the 
following: The Indians broke out of the jail late in 
the evening, and five of them got away. Andrew 
Van Buren and an Indian by the name of Aukewakets 
ran over a pile of rocks and leaped over a fence. As 
they ran over the rock pile each stooped and picked 
up a good sized rock raised up ready to strike. Van- 
Buren being a little the quickest brought the Indian 
to his knees, and then took an old jack knife with a 
broken backspring from his pocket, after which he 
and the Indian clutched each other by the throat. 
Van Buren succeeded in opening the knife with one 
hand and his teeth and cut the Indian's throat. 

When W. A. Cox in the darkness of the night 
passed the end of a pile of fence posts, he thought 



188 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

he saw something move under the end of the posts ; he 
kicked under and an Indian jumpem up with a loud 
"wah." Cox stepped back and with his revolver 
shot the Indian in the bowels. The Indian coming at 
him he fired again and shot the savage in the breast. 
When Warren Snow passed a shed that night an 
Indian came out after him. Brother Snow heard him, 
but it was so dark he could not see him; he struck 
the Indian with his gun, breaking the stock, but kill- 
ed the redskin. 

CHIEF SANPITCH KILLED NEAR MORONI, 
SANPETE COUNTY. 

Five Indians, including Sanpitch, got away and 
made for the west mountain ; a posse went in pursuit 
and on the 18th of the month Chief Sanpitch was 
found hiding in Birch Canyon, between Moroni and 
Fountain Green and was killed. The other four 
were tracked into the mountains between Fountain 
Green and Nephi, south of Salt Creek Canyon. On 
the 19th, Amasa and George Tucker and Dolph Ben- 
nett struck their tracks on the side of the mountain, 
where some men from Moroni joined them, and they 
followed the trail nearly to the top of the moun- 
tain where they overtook and killed three of them. 
They followed the track of the other one, whose 
name was Tackwitch, over the mountain and down 
some distance. Bennett stopped and sat down while 
the others followed the tracks. The Indian doub- 
led on his tracks and came back to a point near 
where Bennett was seated and crawled into a 
patch of oak brush where he covered him-self up with 
leaves. Bennett saw him, and when the men missed 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 189 



bis tracks they came back. Bennett motioned to his 
comrades pointing out where the Indian was hidden. 
At once they surrounded the place and one of the 
men shot and wounded the Indian who jumped up 
and came at Bennett with a large butcher knife. 
Bennett emptied his revolver at him without bring- 
ing him down or stopping him. When within a few 
feet Bennett threw his pistol hitting the Indian on 
the temple and knocking him down. The Indian had 
no more than struck the ground when Bennett was 
on top of him, wrenched the knife from his hand and 
cut his throat. This finished the jailbreakers. 

TOWN OF SALINA VACATED AFTER LOSING 
MOST OF THEIR STOCK. 

On account of the exposed condition of the town 
of Salina, and the people having lost practically all 
their stock that place was abandoned by its inhabi- 
tants April 21, 1866 ; most of them going into San- 
pete County. 

From Whitney's History of Utah we glean the 
the following: Two men who had been engaged in 
strengthening Fort Sanford on the Sevier in Piute 
County, had an engagement with two Indians be- 
longing to Black Hawk's band, April 22, 1866. One 
of the latter was wounded and the other killed. 
Hakes received a severe gunshot wound in the 
shoulder. Immediately afterwards, a number of 
Piedes who were camped near the Fort gave up their 
arms and approached the settlers with overtures of 
peace. This offer being accepted, the settlers at 
another point, thinking the movement genuine and 
general, visited a neighboring Indian camp to induce 



190 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

a cessation of hostilities, only to receive a volley of 
arrows, slightly wounding several of their number; 
they returned the fire with their muskets killing 
two and capturing two of the Indians and putting 
the rest to flight. 

ORGANIZATION OF THE PANGUITCH MILITIA. 

SKIRMISH AT FORT SANFORD. 

JOHN BUTLER WOUNDED. 

Written by John Louder, of Parowan, 

Iron County, Utah. 

An election was held March 21st, 1865. Colonel 
George A. Smith was present. My name was pro- 
posed for Captain and I was elected. This position 
I held until Panguitch was vacated. Previous to 
this, I had raised an independent company of twen- 
ty-five men, called Minute Men of which I was cap- 
tain. A stockade was built about six miles below 
Panguitch, on the east side of the Sevier River 
called "Fort Sanford," opposite to what is and 
was known as Louder 's Springs. I had gone up to 
the stockade on a visit, April 22nd, 1866, and while 
there we noticed two Indians coming up on the west 
side of the river. They fired at some ducks. We 
had orders to take in all the straggling Indians in 
the vicinity; and our doing so was the cause which 
led up to the shooting of William M. West. Mr. 
West took my horse while Collins E. Hakes took 
another, and both rode across the river to inter- 
cept the Indians and bring them to the stockade. 
The Indians objected, and said they were on an ex- 
press from Black Hawk and they wanted to see Lou- 
der; the men told them that Louder was over at the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 191 



stockade. They undertook to pass the men, when 
West rode in front of them, and as he did so, one of 
the Indians caught West's horse by the bit and held 
it, and the other Indian fired at West, hitting him 
in the shoulder. Then a skirmish ensued between 
Hakes and one of the Indians, but their guns failed 
to respond and no damage resulted ; Hakes ' gun was 
a cartridge-make, and the Indians a muzzle-loader. 
Later in the contest, Hakes got the advantage of 
Lis opponent and made a good Indian of him. By 
this time I procured another horse, and made my 
way across the country to the scene of the trouble, 
shooting at the other Indian, and wounding him in 
the shoulder ; in this condition he escaped from me. 
I followed him about four miles and left him in some 
large boulders. Here dusk came on, and as my horse 
was a broncho, I decided to tie him up and 
continue on foot. I finally came back, got my horse 
and went to the fort. 

The next day my father and two or three other 
men trailed the same Indian to a place where some 
other Indians had found him and helped him away. 
Here, however, they found his gun; the evidence 
showed that he had snapped as many as fifty caps 
at me. Noticing this, the men thought there must 
be some defect in the gun; one of them tested it 
and to their astonishment it went off alright. 

The Indian killed at Louder 's Spring was call- 
ed Santick; name of the other Sanford Indian was 
Shegump. Both were on express from Black Hawk's 
band. 

The next day after the fracus at Louder 's Spring 
Major Silas S. Smith ordered me to go up to the In- 
dian camp above Panguitch and take the Indians 



192 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

camped there prisoners, bring them to Panguitch 
and hold them until I received further orders. The 
order was issued by General George A. Smith. Ac- 
cordingly I, with six men who were sent to 
me, and seven or eight others, marched to Pan- 
guitch. On approaching the Indian camp we 
thought it best to divide the party, so as not to ex- 
cite the Indians. We did so, coming in at intervals. 
Old Doctor Bill, one of the occupants of the camp, 
became very excited when I asked for their guns, 
and began looking around for his gun, which was 
found sticking in some brush, in the back end of the 
wigwam. At this juncture another Indian came in 
with his gun in his hand. Coming up to me, he pre- 
tended to hand it to me, but in doing so, held the gun 
in such a manner that he turned the muzzle towards 
me. I caught the gun in my left hand and hurried 
off on my horse. By this time James Butler, one 
of my men, had been shot by Doctor Bill with an ar- 
row in the side. The other men began firing at 
old Bill, severing three fingers from his hand with 
which he was drawing another arrow. When But- 
ler saw me and the Red Lake Indian scuffling he 
came to me with the arrow sticking in his side, and 
with his double barrel gun shot and killed him. I 
then son! John L. Butler down t"> Panguitcla after a 
vehicle to take James Butler, the wounded man, to 
town where he could have his wounds dressed. Dur- 
ing the absence of the Butlers, the rest of the men 
guarded the prisoners. We kept them for a consi- 
derable length of time, until we received orders from 
Colonel Dame to liberate them, and they were con- 
sequently turned loose. The following day after 
Ih e trouble at the camp where we arrested the In-

AMBUSCADE AT MARYSVALE, A. LEWIS AND 
C. CHEISTENSEN KILLED. 

On the night of April 21, 1866, Walter Barney 
and Sidney Wilson were on guard at the public cor- 
ral at Monroe, where most of their stock was en- 
closed. When on their usual rounds about midnight 
they saw a dark object lying by the fence. T! link- 
ing it was an animal that had been left out they 
went to put it in the corral ; but when within two rods 
of the object seen, two Indians jumped up and ran 
away. The guard shot at them with their revolvers. 
The Indians had been trying to dig out some pick- 
ets with their butcher knives in order to make an 
opening to let out the stock. Leaving the town going 
in a south-westerly direction they stopped at An- 
drew Rasmussen's corral and commenced shooting 
his cows, oxen, pigs and sheep with arrows; they 
carried away one sheep and dressed it at the head 
of the ditch where they left a butcher knife. Early 
the next morning messengers were sent to Richfield 
and Glenwood with the report. A company was im- 
mediately formed of men from Glenwood, Richfield 
and Monroe, with Dr. Elias Pierson of Glenwood in 
command. The company numbering twenty-one 
men left Monroe about midnight. The moon was 
shining brightly and they could see the tracks of 
the Indians in the road where they had dragged their 



194 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

lariats, as was their custom. When the company got 
down to the Sevier River they saw a lot of cattle in 
the bottoms, and the appearances were to the effect 
that they had been gathered together by the Indians, 
convenient to be driven off. Having reached this 
place John Wilkenson said to Chris. Christensen, 
with whom he was riding, "If I were in command I 
would stop right here among the cattle, and hold our 
horses till morning ; it will only be an hour or two ; 
and if the Indians come after the stock, we would be 
prepared for them." Shortly before getting to the 
ford of the river Captain Pier son called a halt and 
instructed the boys to keep together and not talk 
loud, nor make any noise, and when in the river let 
their horses drink and proceed quietly up to the 
fort, which was about a mile distant. 

When they had gone about twenty-five yards 
from the fort they came to a stake and rider fence 
with large rabbit brush along by it, where the In- 
dians were concealed, no doubt intending to make a 
break on the little fort early in the morning. They 
permitted the boys to pass but opened fire in their 
back, hitting and killing Albert Lewis instantly; he 
fell off his horse exclaiming, ' ' Oh my God. ' ' Chris- 
tian Christensen who was riding beside Wilkensen 
was mortally wounded ; the ball fired by the Indian 
struck the handle of his pistol, driving part of it and 
the bullet into his bowels. He exclaimed, "Oh, I am 
shot." Wilkinson asked if he was wounded badly. 
He answered, "Yes, feel." Christensen wanted to 
get off his horse, but Wilkenson said "Let us re- 
treat back in the brush." The Indians fired up the 
line, wounding James Mortensen and John Peter- 
sen. The company rode up to the Fort, leaving 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 195 



iiiiiimiiimiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 



Wilkenson with the dead and wounded men. Shortly 
Major Allred and Peter Christensen ( Christensen 's 
brother-in-law) returned and Wilkinson and Allred 
then formed a chair by crossing their hands (one 
man holding the wrist of the other) and carried 
the wounded man up to the fort while Peter led the 
horses. Lewis was left where he fell till morning, 
which was not long. The Indians took the cattle 
and drove them up the Valley southward. The com- 
pany followed and when up five or six miles they 
saw the Indians driving the stock up what they 
called Bock Canyon across the valley eastward. It 
was probably the east fork of the Sevier river. 
There, on a ridge, they met about forty men from 
Circleville. Next a council was held to decide whe- 
ther the men should follow the Indians into the 
mountains and try to recover the stock, or turn back. 
They decided on the latter course, the Circleville 
people going home and the others returning to the 
the Vale (Marys vale). Obtaining a light wagon of 
James Monson, they wrapper Lewis's body in a 
quilt and brought it home. 

Next day Major Claus Peter Andersen with 
three or four men secured a pair of large mules and 
a light wagon from John Eeidhead and went after 
the wounded men. Christian Christensen lived 21 
days. He was married to his betrothed, Nicoline 
Bertelsen on his death-bed. 

The killed and wounded were all residents of 
Richfield. Both Lewis and Christensen were buried 
in the old Richfield cemetery. 

On May 1st, 1866, President Brigham Young 
issued orders for the people in the outlying settle- 
ments to move together in companies of not less than 



196 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



one hundred and fifty in each as a means of safety 
and protection. 

THOMAS JONES KILLED AND WM. AVERY 

WOUNDED AT FAIRVIEW. 

PRESIDENT YOUNG ADVISES THE PEOPLE TO 
MOVE TOGETHER. 

While on picket guard near Fairview, Sanpete 
County, a Thomas Jones was killed and William 
Avery wounded, April 29, 1866. Hyrum Wilson was 
with them, sitting down engaged in reading, while 
the others were exercising themselves by jumping. 
Wilson got Avery on a horse and took him to where 
he thought him safe and there let him down where- 
upon he rode to town and reported. . 

Elias Cox, Wm. Zahriskie and some others went 
in pursuit of the Indians; they saw the murderers 
but did not overtake them. 

Colonel Eeddick Allred records the following 
in his journal: "The people in Sanpete had a Co-op 
herd of stock in Thistle Valley in charge of Noah 
T. Guyman who camped there in the valley together 
with his family. The Indians made a raid on Fair- 
view killing one man and wounding another. Fear- 
ing for the safety of the herd and family with it, I 
went into the valley with a company in the night, it 
being so dark that we could not see the man next 
to us in line. Thomas Coates of Mount Pleasant pi- 
loted us safely through; we found the family and 
stock safe and moved all into the settlement next 
day and delivered them to President J. A. Allred. 
The following day (May 1st) President Brigham 
Young issued instructions to the people in Sanpete, 
Sevier and Piute Counties to move together, in bod- 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 197 



ies of not less than one hundred and fifty men, arm 
themselves well, and protect themselves and their 
stock. The people in the small settlements in Piute 
County moved to Circle ville, those at Monroe and 
Glenwood in Sevier County to Eichfied, those at 
Fayette, Sanpete County to Gunnison, those at 
Fairview, Sanpete to Mount Pleasant and those at 
Fountain Green and Wales to Moroni in Sanpete 
County. 

DODGE SENDS WORD TO CALL 
OUT THE MILITIA. 

On May 2nd, 1866, General Dodge sent a com- 
munication to Colonel Potter, Superintendent of In- 
dian affairs to the effect that he would have to de- 
pend for the present on the militia to compell the 
Indians to behave. Before the message had been 
comunicated to him, Colonel Heath, in company with 
Governor Durkee had paid a visit to the Indians at 
Corn Creek, Millard County, and succeeded in ob- 
taining from them renewed assurance of peace. He 
also visited the Uintah reservation, to which some 
of the Indians had by this time removed. His ar- 
rival appears to have been very timely, for Tabby 
and his braves were about to join the notorious Black 
Hawk in his raids upon the southern settlements. 
The visit also resulted in holding the reservation 
Indians to their neutrality. 

Franklin H. Heath of Wisconsin had succeeded 
Colonel Irish as Indian Superintendent. He had 
acted for some time as private secretary to Gover- 
nor Durkee, and was confirmed as Superintendent 
of Indian affairs in March, 1866. Like his predeces- 
sor, Colonel Heath was an energetic official. 



198 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

The spring of 1866 found the military spirit at 
its highest pitch. Division, brigade and regimental 
musters and elections were held in almost every 
county in Utah and reorganization of the entire 
militia in Utah was effected. Among the promo- 
tions and changes occurring about this time may 
be mentioned the election of Brigadier-General Brig- 
ham Young, Jr. of Salt Lake County, Brigadier- 
General Lot Smith of Davis County, Major-General 
Aaron Johnson, and Brigadier-General Wm. B. 
Pace and Albert K. Thurber of Utah County. The 
interest manifested on these occasions explains the 
readiness with which the people responded to the 
call to arms and the efficiency of the service ren- 
dered in the Indian campaign of 1866. 

The earliest calls upon the northern counties had 
not been for armed assistance to chastise the rene- 
gades and wreck vengence upon them, but for men 
to aid the settlers in pro tecting themselves and their 
stock until they could reach places of safety; but 
the increasing boldness of the marauders rendered 
decisive action necessary. The entire abandonment 
of the southern counties, to be followed by a general 
Indian war, seemed to be the only alternative. Steps 
were accordingly taken to place the settlements south 
and east of Salt Lake City in a state of defense, and 
troops were ordered to the scene of hostilities. By 
the 1st of May, 1866, several companies from Davis, 
Salt Lake and Utah counties were on the march, and 
on arriving in Sanpete county they reported to Bri- 
gadier-General Warren S. Snow. A company of 
cavalry from Salt Lake City under Colonel Heber 
P. Kimball and Major John Clark, reached Manti 
on the 5th of May, and was ordered to march up the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 199 

Sevier river and assist the settlers in moving into 
Sanpete Valley. These men displayed great energy 
and succeeded in delivering the exposed settlers, 
after which for a short time they were stationed at 
Fountain Green. 

KIMBALL'S AND CONOVER'S COMMANDS 
ARRIVE AT MANTI. 

Kimball's and Conover's Companies arrived 
at Manti, May 6th, 1866 and about the 10th 
a company of cavalry (A. G. Conover, captain) 
reached the scene of hostilities (from Utah county) 
and were ordered to occupy a picket post on the Se- 
vi er river near the abandoned town of Salina, un- 
der command of Brigadier-General William B. Pace. 

CHRISTIAN LARSEN, A HERDER KILLED 
ON SPANISH FORK BENCH. 

On the 16th of May a party of ten Indians swoop- 
ed do\vn from the mountains near Spanish Fork and 
killed Christian Larsen who was herding cows on 
the bench ; they also made off with nearly two hun- 
dred head of horses from the vicinity. Earlier in the 
month a raid was made upon the horse herd of 
friendly Indians at Corn Creek, Millard County. 
The thieves were pursued for several days by Kan- 
osh and some members of his band, but were not 
overtaken. 

Iron, Kane and Millard and all the counties 
south had their own troubles, yet eavu of them sont 
aid ino Sanpete anl Sevier counties. The most north- 
erly point to send such assistance was Davis Coun- 
ty, where early in July Brigadier-General Lot Smith 



200 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

mustered a company of cavalry under Captain Big- 
ler for ninety days service; and as late as October 
Captain Eobert W. GDavis and company from Kays- 
ville started for the Sevier. About the end of July 
Major-General Burton organized another company 
of seventy-five officers and men in Salt Lake Coun- 
ty and hurried them southward under command of 
Major Andrew Burt, with William L. N. Allen as 
captain. These were Colonel John Sharp 's regiment 
and were among the last to return home, reaching 
Salt Lake City early in November. Utah County 
sent its second company of cavalry in June under 
Captain Joseph Cluff of Provo, and two more com- 
panies in August under Captain Alva Green of 
American Fork and Caleb W. Haws of Provo. 

Of the various companies and commanders do- 
ing duty in their own counties it is perhaps not nec- 
essary to speak in detail, though they aquitted them- 
selves with much credit. As far south as Washing- 
ton County where, under instructions of Brigadier- 
General Erastus Snow, a company under Captain 
James Andrus had taken the field and had lost in 
one expedition private Eliajh Everett Jr., slain by 
the savages ; and as far north as Cache County there 
were the same alert and unceasing watchfulness 
against hostile inroads or outbreaks, and at one time 
during the year as many as twenty five hundred 
men were under arms. The number killed during 
the season's campaign was of whites about twenty 
and of Indians between forty and fifty. The set- 
tlers stock herds were reduced nearly two thousand, 
and rarely were any of the animals recovered.

OLD FATHER J. R. IVIE AND HENRY 
WRIGHT KILLED AT SCIPIO. 

On the morning of June 10, 1866, a large band 
of Indians under Chief Black Hawk made a raid on 
the stock in Bound Valley, Millard County. They 
killed old father James R. Ivie, father of Colonel 
J. L. Ivie, J. Ivie, and others, and mortally wounded 
Henry Wright, who were out looking for stock, and 
drove off about 500 head of cattle and horses. As it 
was known that they would come towards Salina, a 
messenger was dispatched to Fort Gunnison, where 
it was known that General Wm. B. Pace with a com- 
pany of thirty men were stationed. But when word 
of the trouble at Scipio reached the camp, General 
Pace and a few others were on the way to Manti. 
A messenger was dispatched post haste, and caught 
up with the party at Twelve Mile Creek, just below 
the presnt site of Mayfield. The company returned 
to Gunnison through a heavy thunder storm. Sal- 
ina which had been vacated in April, was reached by 
daylight, and here it was decided to take a few hours 
rest. Accordingly, the pickets were sent out, and the 
men began to prepare for a rest, but had not pro- 
ceeded very far when one of the guards discharged 
his gun, which was the signal agreed upon that the 
enemy had been sighted. 

GEN. PACE'S BATTLE AT GRAVELLY FORD. 
WM. TUNBRIDGE WOUNDED. 

Looking to the southwest, and just opposite the 
Gravelly Ford could be seen a band of Indians driv- 
ing a bunch of cattle. They were evidently trying to 
make the ford, which if reached in time would give 



202 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



imiiiiiiimimiiM tin 



them the passes to the mountains on the east, and 
insure them a clean getaway with the stock. General 
Pace ordered an advance, and the distance of eight 
miles to the Gravelly Ford was covered under whip. 
The advance guard was about two hundred yards in 
the lead when the point of the mountain was reached 
and they were permitted to pass, but when the com- 
pany reached that place they were fired upon by 
the Indians from ambush at the close range of sixty 
paces. 

The whites were commanded to cross-fire, and 
the Indians were routed, but about this time the In- 
dians were reinforced from the band driving the cat- 
tle on the west. A guard of Indians was left over 
the cattle on the west side of the river, while Indians 
to the number of sevnty-five or eighty engaged in 
fighting on the east side. 

The whites retreated to higher ground and made 
the crest of a hill serve as breast-works for them. 
While making this retreat, William Tunbridge was 
wounded in the leg just as he was mounting his 
mule, but when assisted in his saddle, he continued 
to fight. 

After reaching the higher ground, the Indians 
surrounded the whites and began to close in on them 
until by command the militia began to fire by plat- 
toons ; this manner of fighting proved very effective, 
for at every fire an Indian or his horse would drop. 
Then the Indians began to circle around, and when 
a point of advantage was gained, they fired on the 
whites. There was one particular point from which 
most of the shooting was done. A wash led in the 
direction of the point, and James E. Snow determin- 
ed to put a stop to the practice of firing from it. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 203 



He followed the wash nearly to the mouth, and then 
dropped behind a large sage-brush, which he used for 
a rest to shoot from. He soon got range on an In- 
dian who was trying to put one of his wounded on a 
horse. The horse being between Snow and the In- 
dian, he could not see the body of the Indian, but 
judging from the position of his feet and legs, he 
decided that by shooting the horses through the 
body in the region of the heart the same shot would 
get the red man. The aim proved true, for at the 
report of the rifle the horse fell and the Indian was 
wounded. He was picked up by two of his braves 
and spirited away. 

The wounded Indian was none other than the 
famous Black Hawk, though at the time it was n->t 
known. Mr. Snow had a narrow escape in this af- 
fair, for he was fully 600 yards from the rest of the 
whites and was closely pursued by three of the en- 
emy. While getting away from them, Snow caught 
his saber between his legs and fell. Four men were 
dispatched to resue him and thus he was saved from 
the torture of the red men. 

When the tide of the battle seemed turned in favor 
the whites, though their ammunition was by this 
time exhausted, a cloud of dust from the direction 
of Bound Valley suggested to the militia that more 
Indian were coming ; a retreat was therefore ordered. 
Black Hawk's good fortune again befriended him; 
the approaching horsemen were a company of Fill- 
more cavalry, seventy strong under Captain Owens. 
Before they effected a junction with General Pace 
the slippery foe were safe in their mountain fast- 
nesses. 



204 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

A RACE FOR LIFE. 

On the evening of June 10th, four soldiers, J. 
H. Noakes, Uel Stewart, Eliel Curtis of Springville 
and Moroni Manwill of Pay son, were carrying dis- 
patches from Gunnison to Glenwood, it rained on 
them nearly all the way and traveling was bad, con- 
sequently it was late when they arrived at Glen- 
wood, where they found but one person, namely Art 
temus Millet. They stayed with him over night, 
as their horses were jaded; leaving the dispatches 
with Millett they started back to their company, and 
arrived at the ridge that runs down to the river at 
Rocky Ford, about half a mile south of the Gravelly 
Ford. When they got onto the ridge, they saw the 
Indians in the act of driving the stock across the 
river at the Gravelly Ford, but could not see the com- 
pany of militia under Pace. Noakes said, "this is 
no place for us ; if we go on, the Indians will get us." 
As they turned to go back to Glenwood, the Indians 
saw them, and about sixteen of them gave chase. 
Three of the men were mounted on good horses, but 
Curtis was riding a small mustang that they called 
Tom Thumb. The boys put spurs to their horses and 
made the best time possible, while the savages stead- 
ily gained on the mustang. Seeing this, the boys 
told Curtis to spur forward, and they would drop 
behind and check the reds. The boys turned in their 
saddles several times and fired a volley which check- 
ed the pursuers. Then they again overtook their 
comrade and stayed with him until their copper-col- 
ored warriors came close. Then the three again 
halted and checked the enemy until their friend was 
a sufficient distance in advance when they again

minium i ii in n iiiiiiimmmimi lllllllllllllilii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinii 

swept forward. This maneuver was made several 
times and the ride made in safety. During the five- 
irile race Noakes shot one Indian off his horse and 
Stewart shot a horse. In the meantime news of the 
light was received by General Snow at Manti. Col- 
onel Kimball with his cavalry, then stationed at 
Fountain Green, was ordered to report at once at 
headquarters. In thirty minutes the command was 
in the saddle, and before daylight next morning was 
at Manti, where it remained most of the day under 
waiting orders until reinforcements should arrive 
from Mount Pleasant. That night a short march 
was made, and the combined forces now under per- 
sonal command of General Snow went into camp. 
The impatience of the men who wanted to overtake 
the Indians by forced march and engage them could 
hardly be restrained by the cautious commander, 
who, taught by experience had no relish for rushing 
recklessly into a possible ambuscade. The march 
was resumed the next morning, and at noon the 
troops came upon the previous night's camping 
ground of the Indians in a canyon at the western 
edge of Castle Valley. A council of war was called, 
and though the young officers and the majority of 
the men were in favor of an advance at the best pos- 
sible speed, the General decided that without heavy 
reinforcements it would be imprudent to continue 
the case. 

GEN. WELLS AND MILITIA LEAVE GREAT SALT 

LAKE CITY FOR SANPETE. 

GEN. WELLS TAKES COMMAND OF THE MILITIA 
IN SANPETE. 

In the meantime Lieutenant-General Wells 
(leaving Salt Lake on the llth), reached Gun- 



206 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

nison, accompanied by a body of cavalry under Col- 
onel John R. Winder, followed by a company of in- 
fantry from the regiment of Col. Samuel W. Rich- 
ards under command of Major William W. Cas- 
per and Peter Sinclair, battalion adjutant, with 
Jesse West as captain and Alexander Burt, Byron 
Groo and others as lieutenants. The cavalry force 
was assigned to patrol duty along the Sevier River, 
and the infantry detailed to the settlements of San- 
pete. 

Colonel Winder was immediately assigned to 
duty as assistant adjutant to General Wells ; the lat- 
ter gave orders that the pursuit of Black Hawk 
should be at once resumed and another effort made 
to recover the stock; the trail of the savages was 
again struck and after passing the point where the 
pursuit had been abandoned, the troops found that 
they had been at the time within twelve miles of the 
enemy and the stolen cattle. 

A longer march confronted them now, and one 
beset with many difficulties. The trail was follow 
ed over rocky ridges, up and down almost impassa- 
ble gorges, across occasional streams of alkali water 
and into the most forbidding and desolate deserts. 
At the conclusion of the first day's march the men 
He followed the wash nearly to the mouth, and then 
and animals were well-nigh exhausted from the trials 
of the journey, all having suffered intensely from 
thirst. (During two days more and the larger part of 
the two nights the toilsome march continued; and 
when futility of further pursuit was recognized and 
the condition of the troops was seen to be perilious, 
a retreat was again ordered, and it was none too 
soon; the command was scarcely able to get out of 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 207 



the desert, owing to weakness of both horses and 
men ; of the latter there were several whose mouths 
and tongues were so sore, that they could scarcely 



CAPTAIN A. P. DEWEY WAS ORDERED 
TO ESTABLISH A POST IN THISTLE VALLEY. 

A lew days later, Jun:> the 21st, Captain Al- 
boi t P. iJewey of Colonel Kimoall'^ eomm&rd was 
ordered to establish a post in Thistle Valley in the 
north end of Sanpete county a point that was con- 
sidered the key to any probable attack from that di- 
rection. His command consisted of twenty-two cav- 
alry and thirty-five infantry, the latter under Cap- 
tain Jesse West, who started from Moroni on the 
21st of June. 

On the evening of the 23rd of June the In- 
dians gave indications of their presence in the vic- 
inity of the camp in Thistle Valley, and extra pre- 
cautions were taken to guard against a surprise. 

Hyrum Murphy of Captain Dewey's company 
states that when the company first went to Thistle 
Valley, they were camped by the wagon road, near 
the Warm Springs ; but feed being better and more 
convenient elsewhere, the camp was moved up east 
about a mile and a half to a more exposed location ; 
and during the night of the 23rd of June an object 
resembling in the dark, a small bear crawling round 
camp, occasionally howling like a coyote, came close 
by a bed in which slept two boys. The guard saw and 
shot at it, when it ran away. It was afterwards be- 
lieved to be an Indian trying to locate the horses, and 
ascertain the condition of the camp. 



208 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

BATTLE IN THISTLE VALLEY. 

On Sunday morning, the 24th of June about 
nine o'clock, most of the horses were driven to feed 
in a cove about half a mile south east of camp. With- 
out the knowledge of the militia, Indians were scat- 
tered through the cedars and ravines east and south 
of camp at that time. Charles Brown of Draper, 
Salt Lake County, and a companion were in the 
cedars near the horses picking gum, when they saw 
Indians. They ran for camp, and when out in the 
flat, Brown was shot through the back. When he 
fell some Indians shot him with arrows. The boys 
in camp seeing what had happened ran out to his 
assistance, and brought him into camp, where he 
expired. The Indians made a rush for the horses, 
stampeded them and ran down between the hills 
and camp, about half a mile west, when the Indians 
turned them south into the so-called Indian Hol- 
lows, where they caught some of them and rode them 
back to fight the troops. 

They soon made a charge, but were turned back 
by a volley from camp. All the breast-works the 
troops had were four wagons on the south side of 
camp ; two of these were loaded with wood. The In- 
dians surrounded the camp, and closed in upon it 
keeping behind trees and brush. Some of them ap- 
proached in a wash that ran north of camp. They 
shot into the camp wounding Thomas Snarr of Salt 
Lake. 

Captain Dewey had sent out two companies of 
scouts, four men in each company, one company go- 
ing north and the other south-west. Two of these 
going north were at the Warm Springs. John Ham- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 209 



liton and Homer Roberts who were farther north, 
saw the Indians take the horses and came back to 
camp. They were immediately sent to Mount Plea- 
sant to report. The others were chased by the In- 
dians but got into camp safely. The Indians who 
did not know that an express had been sent kept 
the direction to the settlements south closely guard- 
ed. The fo? lowing account was obtained from Eskild 
O. Petersen, one of Colonel Ivie's men: 

When the express arrived at Mount Pleasant, 
Col. John L. Ivie with his company of cavalry hap- 
pened to be up Pleasant Creek Canyon and through 
the hills scouting, the cow-herd being in the foot- 
hills below them. About two p. m. they heard three 
shots down the canyon, and they gathered at the 
herd and was ordered to help gather the stock. Pre- 
sently they heard five more shots, farther down the 
canyon, and they knew that to be a signal, upon which 
they left the stock and rode down to the mouth of 
the canyon, when they were informed that the Salt 
Lake boys were being attacked in Thistle Valley and 
needed help. They were ordered to get there as 
quickly as their horses could take them. The distance 
to town was about four miles and when they got 
there they received their orders and started for the 
north. When they reached Fairview, six or eight 
men were ready to accompany them; and they ar- 
rived in Thistle Valley about an hour before sun- 
down. The Indians by this time had the camp sur- 
rounded, and the boys were keeping the enemy back 
the best they could without exposing themselves to 
the fire of the savages. Their ammunition, how- 
ever, was nearly exhausted and the Indians had all 
their horses except six, and these were all wounded. 



210 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

When Ivie 7 s company reached the valley the sav- 
ages intercepted them, one Indian who seemed most 
daring rode out in the open. The Colonel dismount- 
ed and with his Henry rifle took a shot at him ; the 
redskin lopped over on the side of his horse. Some 
of the other Indians rode out and drove the horse 
with its limp rider back into the cedars. Another 
Indian had left his horse and was sneaking in the 
wash, when Orange Seeley and R. N. Bennett rushed 
up and got the horse with saddle, bridle, a long lasso 
and a buckskin jacket. Seely kept the horse as a 
trophy of war. At that time it was not known what 
the conditions were at camp, so the troops made 
haste to get there. After an exchange of a few shots 
the besiegers drew off with their booty. 

About dusk Colonel Ivie's men hitched their 
horses onto the company wagons and moved them 
down to the wagon road more in the middle of the 
Valley, where they would be less exposed, in case of 
a night attack. The Indians had fought the boys 
all day and if they had not received help there is 
no doubt but that the Indians would have taken the 
camp, as the savages were receiving reinforcements 
during the day, Brown's body was taken to Mount 
Pleasant. The writer and three others arrived at 
the camp the following day with provisions from 
Mt. Pleasant and militia men arrived there during 
the day from all parts of Sanpete county. Colonel 
Kimball and his command arrived early in the morn- 
ing and about the same time Major Casper came upon 
the scene from Moroni with General Snow of Manti 
in command; the pursuit of the retreating savages 
was hotly begun by the combined force of militia, 
the trail of the Indians being plainly marked by 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 211 



the blood from their dead and wounded, whom, in 
accordance with their custom, they bore away with 
them. The chase lasted until Soldier Summit, at 
the head of Spanish Fork River, was reached. Here 
the Indians, resorted to their old tactics of separat- 
ing and scattering in all directions and further chase 
had to be abandoned. This was the last military 
event of importance in Sanpete County that sea- 
son, and a few weeks afterwards the larger part of 
the troops from the northern counties (most of them 
having been in the service from sixty to ninety days) 
returned and were mustered out. They had conduct- 
ed themselves with much patience and bravery, and 
had rendered invaluable service to the settlers in 
the threatened counties. General Wells and his of- 
ficers showed good judgment in their disposition of 
the troops and inspired confidence throughout the 
entire district. It was felt that against leaders of 
less watchfulness and prudence the crafty Black 
Hawk and his braves would have been able to cause 
far greater losses in life and property. But 
with the withdrawal of the outside militia, the efforts 
of the local militia organizations were not relaxed. 
The men rendered uncomplaining service on picket 
guard and in occasional reconnoisances into the 
mountains, and the officers were vigilant and full 
of energy. 

Their scanty crops had to be harvested, and win- 
ter's supply of fuel gathered, protection furnished 
their remaining flocks and herds, and winter's for- 
age provided. All this work had to be performed by 
men under arms or attended by an armed escort. 
And it is remembered that the sleepless foe ranged 
over and ravaged a district three hundred miles in ex 



212 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 

tent, burning saw-mills, ranges and isolated ranches, 
and causing the abandonment of a number of flou- 
rishing villages. The heroism of the settlers in re- 
sisting by night and day the terrifying attacks of 
the marauders is worthy of the warmest praise. In 
nearly every part of the Territory regular guard 
duty was ordered. Even in Salt Lake County, the 
Lieutenant-General issued orders as early as May, 
1866, to Major-General Robert T. Burton to have 
patrols out for the protection of stock and to ob- 
serve the movements and temper of the Indians. 

In the settlements on the west side of the Jor- 
dan river, Salt Lake county there was much regular 
work of this character under the organization of 
increased military companies during the early sum- 
mer. Utah County, populous and well prepared as 
it was, did not entirely escape the ravages of the 
Indians. 

REPORTED BY JOEL ANDREW JOHNSON 
ONE OF MAJOR CLUFF'S MEN. 

Major Joseph Cluff 's cavalry company consis- 
ting of twenty cavalrymen and two baggagemen left 
Provo, for Sanpete and Sevier counties June 13, 
1866 ; they went through Salt Creek Canyon and on 
to Twelve Mile Creek (now MayfieldS going as an 
escort to General Wells as far as Circleville, in con- 
nection with others. When General Wells returned, 
an escort of six of Major Cluff 's command escorted 
him to the Prickly Pear Ridge between Marysvale 
and Monroe. The escort returned to Circlevalle and 
stayed there while the inhabitants prepared to va- 
cate the town. Some of the people went to Beaver 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 213 

and Iron Counties and Major Cluff ' s command es- 
corted those who came north as far as Fort Gunni- 
son. They were six days making the trip and cele- 
brated the fourth of July at Gunnison, after which 
they were sent back to Mayf ield again where they en- 
gaged in camp and scout duty until released to re- 
turn home. A part of the command went to Fish 
Lake with others, pursuing the Indians who stole 
the stock from Scipio; they were gone from home 
forty-four days, or from the 13th of June till the 
27th of July. 

While stationed at Gunnison, two of Major 
Cluff ? s command deserted, namely William Nelson 
and John Baum. They were seen crossing over the 
ridge between Gunnison and Warm Creek. General 
Wells was asked " Shall we follow them and bring 
them back. ' ' The General scatched his head, studied 
a while and then replied 1 1 No, let the poor devils go ; 
they don't know what they are doing. " 

When the Circleville settlers left Gunnison 
they camped the first night on the Sanpitch river 
between Twelve and Nine Mile creeks. Eight of 
Major Cluff's command were sent to guard their 
camp during the night ; they were posted on a ridge 
northeast of camp. Two of the guards held their 
horses in a swale out of sight all night, while the 
others guarded an Indian trail that led to Warm 
Creek (Fayette.) 

BATTLE IN DIAMOND FORK, EDMUNDSON 

AND DIMMICK KILLED. 
Copied from History of Springville. 

A band of Indians came down Maple Canyon in 
Utah county, June 26, 1866 and made a foray into 



214 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



the valley as far as Roundy's pasture and drove 
off some fifty horses and twenty head of cattle into 
Maple canyon. H. M. Dougall and D. E. Deal had 
been the mounted videttes ' the previous day and had 
patrolled the country between Hobble Creek and 
Spanish Fork Canyon, camping with the squad over 
night at the first bridge in the former canyon. As 
il ey rode into town early the next morning they 
met Bishop Johnson, who asked them if they had 
seen any Indians. Their reply was "No, no sign of 
Indians. Everything is all right. The Bishop re- 
plied, "No, everything is not all right: the Indians 
came down Maple canyon last night and took a herd 
of cattle from Markham's pasture at Spanish Fork, 
and some horses from Roundy's pasture. Go tell 
Colonel Bromley to come quickly. " Bromley was 
summoned. The old bell spoke, the drains beat, 
and in twenty mintues several of the mounted minute 
men were on the public square, armed and ready to 
go. It was about 9 a. m. and a dispatch had been 
sent to Colonel Creer of Spanish Fork to meet 
the Springville squad at the mouth of Maple canyon, 
and all proceed under the command of Creer on the 
trail of the hostiles. Alma Spafford, H. 0. Crandall, 
T. L. Mendenhall, J. A. Groesbeck, John Edmund- 
fcorj, Loren Dibble, D. C. Johnson and an old soldier 
by the name of Gillispie, and Wiley Thomas of Span- 
ish Fork composed the posse. The other members 
of the minute company were in the fields and could 
not be reached in time. A gallop of thirty minutes 
brought the young troopers to the mouth of the can- 
yon, but by the indications Creer 's men had arrived 
first and gone up the canyon. Our 'boys rode 
rapidly after them mile after mile, until they had 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 215 

crossed the divide and descended the steep trail in- 
to the head of Diamond Fork, but could see nothing 
of the Spanish Fork troopers. There were three 
young madcaps in the squad that day, who kept rid- 
ing ahead in their anxiety to find the Indians. 
When the party came within a half mile of the 
spot where the skirmish took place, the three 
boys who were still ahead rode up on a knoll 
and gave a whoop, for a little way in advance they 
could see Creer's men under a clump of trees and fir- 
ing over towards the south side of the broad flat 
canyon. With a yell the advance guard charged to- 
ward their white friends, followed by the boys in 
the rear. Just as the three mad-caps got within a 
hundred yards of the party they were suddenly fired 
upon by a number of Indians, who at that moment 
were in the act of flanking the Spanish Fork boys. 
They had found their Indians, but instead of engag- 
ing them in a hand combat, Dibble turned to the right 
and came back to the main body ; Groesbeck was un- 
horsed by the breaking of his saddle girth, but clung 
to the halter strap as his horse circled to the left and 
came back to his comrades in the rear. Edmpndson 
kept straight ahead and to the left of the Spanish 
Forkers, until he was lost to view by the intervening 
brush. 

The Springville boys quickly dismounted, and 
leaving their horses with one of the men, advanced 
cautiously toward Creer's command. At this junc- 
ture several Indians were seen to retreat hastily 
from their position on the south and disappear in 
the thickets which hedged Diamond creek. The 
Spanish Fork boys had been in their position for an 
hour and had seen some warm work. Al Dimmick 



216 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

was fatally wounded and lay upon a bed of leaves 
in the shade. In a few moments an Indian appear- 
ed upon the bluff and by his excited gestures seem- 
ed to be haranguing his men. Some shots were ex- 
changed, but the effect was not known, as both sides 
were laying low. 

Presently Colonel Creer selected five long range 
rifles and began volley firing at the chief, some 800 
yards distant, and at about the fifth volley the In- 
dian fell upon the neck of his horse, which ran be- 
hind the hill and out of sight. The Indians were then 
seen scampering over the ridge, and were variously 
estimated at from twenty to fifty. All was quiet 
for the next half hour and a careful scout was made, 
but no sign of the enemy was visible and it was con- 
cluded that they had drawn off with their dead and 
wounded and would renew the attack after night fall. 
Feeling sure of a night attack, a courier was sent to 
town for help. The man who volunteered to undertake 
this perilous task the the old veteran, Gillispie. It 
was 4 p. m. when he departed and he reached town 
about 7 p. m. with the news of the figh, the extreme 
peril of the white men and that Edmundson was p,,ss 
ing. The tocsin bell, in quick sharp tones brought the 
minute men from their quarters, and by 8 p. m. they 
had started under the direction of the scout to re- 
lieve their companions from their extreme peril. 

In the meantime the Indian camp which had 
been abandoned at the beginning of the attack by 
the whites with all it contained, was relieved, iw the 
Spanish Fork contingent, of the butcher knives, new 
hats ; bridles and lariats which the enemy had left in 
his flight. One man had nine new army hats, and 
the others each had some trophy. Poor Dimmick 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 217 



was tenderly placed upon a litter and just after sun- 
set the party sarted on their return, expecting at 
any moment to hear the crack of the deadly rifle 
land the piercing war-whoop. They were compelled 
Eo carry their wounded comrade, who groaned in 
Jagony at every step. At times he entreated his 
bearers to kill him and end his sufferings. Tire- 
less the troops ascended the eastern slope of the 
mountain out of the Diamond, winding up the precip- 
itous and hazardous mountain trail. The front and 
rear guards kept keenly on the alert, in order to pre- 
sent an ambush. About midnight the pass was 
reached and the descent upon the home side of the 
mountain began. Near the summit the relief party 
was met and not until then did the returning party 
realize that it was safe. Still slowly the homeward 
journey was continued and completed just at day- 
break. 

In front of the old hall they were met by Bishop 
Johnson who praised the boys for their good work, 
told them to get a few hours sleep and at the call of 
the bell to assemble for the purpose of returning to 
the scene of the fight to search for Edmundson, who 
had not returned. It was thought he had escaped 
and would perhaps reach home through some of the 
canyon passes. Alas ! vain hopes ! the poor boy lay up- 
on the lonely hillside cold in death, with the moon 
shining in his upturned face. 

At 7 a. m. the loud alarm bell called the weary 
troopers from their blankets and in a very few mo- 
ments they were on the march, under the command 
of Captain Steele. At the mouth of Maple Canyon 
they found Col. Creer with his company. This morn- 
ing they had deemed it advisable to wait for the 



218 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

Springville contingent. Under command of Colonel 
Creer the party proceeded to the scene of the combat 
of the previous day. They found the camp intact, the 
enemy not having returned for his camp equipage. 
There were seventeen saddles by actual count, and 
other trappings used by native riders, but no other 
appearance of an enemy. The day before the hostiles 
had killed two or three beeves, and large flitches of 
juicy steaks still hung upon the rocks and brush 
where the thieves had placed them to sun-dry. The 
horses were left under the guard of a part of the 
troops, while the others in squads trailed the hills 
in every direction in search of traces of the missing 
man. After a toilsome search and just about sun- 
down his mangled body was found three-fourths of a 
mile north of the battle ground. He had been strip- 
ped of his shirt, his right hand was severed at the 
wrist, his scalp torn off and the savage foe had shot 
him twice through the heart, the muzzle of the wea- 
pon being held so close that the body was powder- 
burned. A signal gun was fired to notify the search- 
ers that the hunt was ended, and all gathered quickly 
to their horses. When the boys came in they brought 
some stolen stock, among which was a horse belong- 
ing to Wm. Smith with blood stains upon the withers 
and down the front leg the animal supposedly had 
been ridden by the war-chief the previous day. The 
dead man was placed upon this horse by Thomas 
Dallm and then came a discussion as to whether the 
pompany should return home via Spanish Fork Can- 
yon, there being a good wagon road all the way, or 
take the trail back through Maple canyon. It was 
eventually decided to take the back trail and the 
bugle sounded the advance. At this juncture the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



horse with the dead rider began to buck and rear and 
plunge in a fearful manner and could not be quieted. 
It was held a moment while the body could be re- 
moved and strapped upon the back of "Old Beck" 
a family mare belonging to William Mendenhall 
and Richard Mendenhall mounted the refractory 
broncho and the march home-ward was commenced 
and was finished at 3 a. m. and the dead man was 
placed upon a bier in front of the old hall when the 
now thoroughly fatigued rough riders went to rest. 

Hardly had their tired heads sank upon the pil- 
lows when the signal, (three quick flashes) was made 
at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon and seen by 
the guard in the tower, and the bell from its iron 
throat rang out, "Come! Come! Come! Quick! 
Quick! Quick !" a few of the tired riders rallied, 
also some of the citizens in wagons, drove like Jehu 
to the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon and sur- 
prised the guard there by their sudden war like ap- 
pearance. The guard said they had seen Indians 
appear some distance up the canyon and had made 
one light (be upon your guard) ; but as it had been 
only a flash, and fearing the lookout hadn't seen it, 
another handfull of brush had been thrown on the 
fire, which only emitted a faint flash, when a larger 
amount had been put upon the embers and a satisfac- 
tory blaze kindled. The watch-men had seen all 
three of the flashes and acted accordingly. After 
scouring the vicinity of the mouth of the canyon 
where fresh Indian signs were plainly seen, the 
cavalcade returned home. Thus ended three very 
exciting days. Some of the boys had been forty-eight 
hours in the saddle almost without food or sleep. 

The Diamond fight was the most successful en- 



220 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



gagement of the war in this : That the Indians were 
thoroughly whipped, their entire camp equipage fall- 
ing into the hands of the victors, who also brought 
back some of the horses and all of the cattle except 
those killed. A report came from DuChesne not 
long afterwards, that the dusky marauders had eight 
killed and wounded, and that Black Hawk was the 
rider who left his blood-stains upon the captured 
horse. 

On the day after the return of the expedition, 
Dimmick and Edmunds on were buried with mili- 
tary honors. Thus ended the fight on the Diamond, 
which was also the end of the Indian hostilities in 
our vicinity.

A CAVALRY COMPANY LEAVE ST. GEORGE. 

ELIJJAH EVERT KILLED. 
HISTORY OF ST. GEORGE STAKE. 

Trip of a cavalry company from St. George to 
Green Eiver as reported by John S. Adams of An- 
nabella. Dated Sept. 18th. 

A company of sixty-one men from St. George 
and surrounding settlements were ordered out by 
General Erastus Snow as a minute company which 
expected to go as far as Green Eiver. The men from 
the different places met at Gould's Eanch in Wash- 
ington County, twenty-six miles east of St. George on 
the 16th of August, 1866. They were inspected by 
General Snow and Staff. General Snow told the 
boys that if those who were called would obey their 
officers, all would be well with them, if any of them 
were hurt, it would be slightly ; he also said, if any of 
them had been hired to go, they might return home. 
Continuing the journey from Gould's Eanch, August 
18th the men made their first camp on Short Creek, 
where they saw a herd of wild cattle. Captain 
James Andrus, who was in command, detailed six 
men to go after the cattle and drive them to Pipe 
Springs, or Whitemore's ranch. The company went 
on to the place, and that evening the detail brought 
in the cattle, the horses of those driving the cattle 
being well night exhausted, ten or fifteen men were 
sent out to help them in and drive the animals into 
the Whitmore corral ; an old cow that had been tame 
refused to go into the corral, and made an effort 
to fight the men and horses ; finally they had to push 
her along, but she was shot several times before 
reaching the corral. Captain Andrus killed and 



222 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

dressed the cow and three other animals. We stopped 
there two days and jerked the meat, which is done 
by cutting the meat into strips and hanging it on a 
platform made of willows and building a fire under 
it, the fire helping the sun to dry it. On Tuesday, 
the 21st, we mustered in camp one captain, one 1st 
lieutenant, one bugler, four 2nd lieutenants and 
thirty-five privates equipped with good long range 
rifles and revolvers, and we were later reinforced by 
Lieutenant Joseph Fish with eighteen men ILODI 
Parowan in Iron County who left there on the 22nd 
of August. Next day brought us to Skootem-pah, 
where it rained on us all night. Some of the men took 
colds which culminated into chills and fever; the 
next day 's journey brought us to the Par-reah. Here 
six of the disabled men were sent back with the sore- 
backed horses, fourteen in number, and the spare 
camp equipage. These men were Elijah Everett. 
Charles Pinney, George Ishum, Albert Beebe, Fred- 
erick Eeggus and Hyrum Pollock. They started back 
about two o'clock p. m. and at the same time we 
moved camp seven miles to Coal Point. At about 5 :30 
p. m. on Mondoy, August 21st, six miles on the 
way back, the party returning were waylaid by In- 
dians crossing a deep gorge and passing up a steep 
ledge of rocks. The foremost man, Elijah Everett, 
beins: dismounted and leading two animals, was kill- 
ed at first fire. The party were all dismounted and 
leading their animals up a steep acclivity at the time 
the attack was made. George Ishum received an ar- 
row wound in the left shoulder. Supposing there 
were a large party of the Indians, they retreated to 
the opposite side of the gorge and took shelter in the 
cedars. When Everett was shot he exclaimed, "Oh 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 223 

boys ' ' and expired. The boys who had been sent back 
came straggling into camp one or two at a time, all 
reporting that the others had been killed. On learn- 
ing of this disaster, Captain Andrus took about twen- 
ty-five men and went down the Pah-reah, expecting 
to head off the Indians ; they came upon them about 
12 o'clock ascending the point of a mountain. We 
surrounded the place as quickly as possible, but 
darkness came on and the Indians escaped. We re- 
mained until daylight, supposing we had some of 
them driven into a small cove near where we over- 
took them. But in this we were mistaken; the In- 
dians had escaped in the night. However, we got 
all the horses and guns that the savages had captured 
except the two that Everett had with him when he 
was killed. About 10 o'clock a. m. on the 27th (Mon- 
day) we recovered Everett's body, wrapped it in a 
blanket and burier it there, covering the place with 
brush and and rocks. The men all stayed together 
during the balance of the trip. We went up the east 
fork of Pah-reah and through Potato Valley (now 
Escalante). Here we gathered some wild potatoes 
which we cooked and ate them ; they were somewhat 
like the cultivated potato, but smaller. From there 
we went through Rabbit Valley, crossed the Dirty 
Devil Creek (also called Fremont River) and got 
within sight of Green River. We then turned back, 
the country between us and the river being too rough 
and broken to proceed farther. Black Hawk told Mr. 
Adams later (at the time of the treaty) that when 
the men turned away they were within three miles 
of his (Black Hawk) main camp and the stock, that 
he and his warriors were in Sanpete, and that there 
were only old men and squaws left in camp. The 



224 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

company expected to meet the Sanpete boys some- 
where, but missed them. When starting back we 
made a dry camp ; we traveled all the next day and 
made another dry camp. Some of our horses giving 
out, six men were sent back after them on foot, ex- 
pecting to catch the horses and ride them back. The 
horses, however, were rested and would not be caught 
consequently the men had to carry their over-coatB 
and guns and walk and drive the horses; it was a 
rough experience ; one of their number gave out and 
they had a hard time to overtake their companions 
in the evning. The company now went down the east 
fork of the Sevier River, and passed through Circle- 
ville, which had been abandoned in the spring, after 
the crops had been put in; the grain was ripe and 
looked fine ; we turned our horses into a field of oats 
which was inclosed by a fence. From there we went 
up the canyon westward and through Bear Valley, 
where we killed some wild chickens. The following 
day we continued the journey to Parowan where we 
were entertained with a dance arranged in our honor. 
Next day we continued the journey to Cedar City 
where we were well cared for and from there we went 
to our respective homes. 

We were gone from home sixty days to the best 
of my memory. 

It was said that Brother Everett who was 
killed had been hired to go on this expedition and 
that he was one of those who were permitted to re- 
turn home before starting. The personel of the com- 
pany was as follows :

AN EXTRACT FROM JAMES M. PETERSON'S 
DIARY. 

The following is culled from the diary of James 
M. Peterson of Eichfield which gives some additional 
data. Mr. Peterson who is the founder of the first 
bank in Sevier County : * 'April 15th, 1866. I am now 
sixteen years old and subject to military duty. My 
first service in the Black Hawk War was on the 26th 
of April when I was on guard. 

May 3rd, together with Sheriff Nathaniel Han- 
chett and five others I started north with fifty head 
of cattle to buy arms and ammunition for the people 
of Sevier county ; we went by way of Scipio for safe- 

ty. 

Tuesday, May 5th, we began to trade for guns at 
Payson and we also traded at Springville. We paid 
for revolvers thirty to forty dollars each ; we finished 
trading in Salt Lake City on the 14th and returned 
home on the 21st under guard of twenty men. Dur- 
ing our trip we bought eighteen rifles, eleven revol- 
vers and one hundred and forty pounds of ammuni- 
tion, which we had purchased at an enormous price ; 
but these articles were indispensible. June 5th I 
was on picket all day and stood guard at night. 

Sept. 8th a company of militia camping between 
Eichfield and Glenwood took a man prisoner suppos- 
ed to be a spy from the Indians. 

DEATH OF BLACK HAWK. 

Black Hawk, the Indian chief who figured so prom- 
inently in the Utah Indian War in 1865-1867, died 
at Spring Lake Villa, a small settlement situated be- 
tween Payson and Santaquin, Utah County, Utah, in 
1870. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 227 

The following letter gives interesting details : 
A LETTER FROM WILLIAM PROBERT. 
Dated at Provo, Utah, July 1st, 1915. 
Mr. Peter Gottfredson, Springville, Utah. 

Dear sir: I am glad to comply with your re- 
quest to give some items of history of some of the In- 
dian troubles in and near Bound Valley (Scipio) and 
in the following narrative I am sure some of the eron- 
eous stories told in regard to the death of Black- 
Hawk, the great Indian Chief, and also Panacara, an 
inoffensive Indian who made his home in Round 
Valley, may be corrected and the truth of the matter 
given to the people in your proposed history of the 
Indian troubles of early Utah days. 

There are probably a dozen men in Utah who 
claim the honor of killing Black Hawk, none of which 
is true. 

It is true that Black Hawk was severely wounded 
in the fight at Gravelly Ford on the Sevier River, 
near what is now called Vermillion ; but he lived three 
of four years after receiving the wound ; and before 
his death Black Hawk obtained permission from the 
military authorities of the Territory to visit all the 
places where he and his tribe had caused trouble or 
raided. And accompanied by a few (seven or eight) 
warriors, Black Hawk visited every town and vil- 
lage from Cedar City on the South to Payson on the 
north and made peace with the people. On this mis- 
sion of peace he was provided with an escort, usu- 
ally from two to six citizens, from town to town. An- 
sel P. Harmon and myself acted as such escort from 
Holden to Scipio, Millard County. 



328 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



Black Hawk told the people wherever he went 
that he was going home to die and before the end 
came he desired to be at peace with the pale faces. 
Black Hawk died at his wigwam near Spring Lake in 
1869 or 1870 ; the exact date I am unable to give. He 
was buried in the foot hills immediately east and 
south of Spring Lake Villa, Utah County. 

Because of the killing of the old man Ivie 
(James Ivie) in Bound Valley (Scipio) a few years 
before by members of the Black Hawk tribe it was 
feared that the old warrior would be harshly treated 
by the Ivie family on the trip through the valley, 
unless provisions were made in advance for his pro- 
tection from assault from that source. 

The Ivies had previously sworn vengeance, and 
some time before Black Hawk's appearance on his 
mission of peace, the old Indian, Panacara, had been 
shot to death by James A. Ivie. In order to justify 
himself, Ivie charged that Panacara was a spy for 
the Ute Indians on the south, which was not true, as 
Panacara was a special friend of the white people 
in that vicinity and was hated by the Utes. On one 
occasion a band of Utes came to the valley for the 
sole purpose of killing him. Panacara was for a 
number of years before his death " medicine man" 
for the Pahvante tribe whose home was in Millard 
County, and this tribe of Indians was always friend- 
ly with the white settlers. 

Panacara ? s death at the hands of Ivie was 
brought about in this way : The Old Indian came to 
the town of Scipio, and as was customary he car- 
ried a gun. This custom was objected to by the 
military authorities and a rule was adpoted that In- 
dians should not carry arms when visiting the set- 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 229 



tlements. Accordingly the acting justice of the peace 
Benj. Johnson, prevailed upon the old Indian to give 
up his gun. The Indian willingly gave the gun to 
the justice and started out to cross the hills in the 
direction of Oak Creek, when Ivie followed him, and 
out on the flat, about two miles from town, he 
overtook the Indian and without warning shot him 
dead. He was buried where he was killed. 

According to the Indian custom it was "a life 
for a life ' ' and it did not matter to them who it was 
just so they got their revenge by killing a white. For 
the death of Panacara I came nearly losing my 
scalp at the hands of ' ' Nun-ka-tots " (a particular 
friend of Panacara), who lived most of the time 
with him. I was on my way from Deseret to Scipio 
\\ith a load of wheat and on reading a point on the 
desert near Mud-Lake the reflection of a gun showed 
an Indian in hiding behind a mound near the road. 
I jumped off the wagon, ready with my rifle for 
action when the Indian rode away. For seven years 
this Indian avoided me and finally came to me and 
asked if I was "tobuck" now. I told him I was 
not "tobuck" and he said "me no tobuck now'; and 
from then on this Indian and myself were good 
friends.

ATTACK ON THE J. P. LEE RANCH NEAR BEAVER, 
JOSEPH ULYWHITE WOUNDED. 

Dear Brother Gottf redson : 

When I began reading to mother the manuscript 
you inclosed, she began saying, "That is not quite 



230 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



right, you must correct that ; ' ' and by the time it was 
finished she said, "I wish you would just lay that 
aside and write the whole story in your own way, 
and I will help you with the facts. I think we can in 
that way make it more clear than by correcting this.; ' 
I have done so, and Mother says, this is the only 
really true version of the story that has ever been 
told. She is the only survivor of the three grown 
persons present at the affair, and you are the only 
person in all these years who has ever asked her for 
the facts. 

She hopes you will thus apply at headquarters 
for all your other Chronicles, and get them as true 
and straight as this one is. 

With kind regards from Mother and myself . 

L. L. Dalton, Lucinda Lee. 

THE INDIAN ATTACK ON LEE'S RANCH IN 
BEAVER COUNTY. 

In the fall of 1866, Mr. John Percival Lee, with 
most of his family, was on his dairy farm (called 
Hawhorne Dell, situated about eight miles southeast 
of Beaver on a bright little stream called South 
Creek,) busily pushing preparations to return to 
town for the winter. 

He usually spent the winters in town, employed 
in teaching school, and the summers at Hawthorne 
Dell, farming and dairying. Already he had turned 
out some thirty milch cows with their calves along 
with the dry stock, to forage on the good bunch grass 
until spring. The grain was standing in stacks ready 
for the thresher, and Mr. Lee and his young hired 
man, Joseph Lillywhite, were gathering potatoes, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 231 

with the help of several children who assisted to pick 
up the tubers. The plan was to fill the double-bedded 
wagon full, and early next morning take that load to 
town and there make ready for storing the whole 
crop. This was the 22nd of October, and Mr. Lee in- 
tended to take his helper with him, and rather 
thought they could not return on the same day, hav- 
ing so much to do there. 

It was sunset before the load was completed, and 
all the busy workers noticed that the wolves were 
very noisy, and seemed to answer each other from 
many directions. They took no hint, however, even 
when a neighbor from town, Mr. Elliott Willden, who 
had been out on the range, and who tamed to take 
supper with the Lees, remarked that Indians often 
used wolf howls to signal each other and to drive cat- 
tle together. 

After the guest went on his way, Mr. Lee said to 
Kis helper: "Joe, it does seem foolhardy to live on 
a lonely place like this and pay so little attention to 
our firearms. Say, we clean them all up tonight and 
get our ammunition all ready. Then, if we do stay 
in town tomorrow night, Mrs. Lee will not be quite 
defenseless you know." Lightly spoken words and 
long remembered! 

The firearms consisted of one large double-bar- 
relled shotgun (Mr. Lee's favorite weapon), one new, 
excellent repeating rifle, and one good six-shot re- 
volver. The stock of ammunition was found to be 
pitiably small and Mr. Lee resolved to buy some on 
the morrow while in town. The magazine of the rifle 
contained the whole of its stock of cartridges. The 
shotgun and revolver were both loaded up with re- 



232 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

volver balls, with plenty of powder behind them. 
Mrs. Lee assisted in the loading to be sure of under- 
standing all about it, with this preparation the fam- 
ily retired to rest in blissful unconsciousness of the 
danger that was even then hanging over them. All 
night, however, the wolf howls continued and the 
two dogs barked and fretted. 

Before light next morning, the family was astir 
and as soon as the back (west) door wa opened, 
the dogs barked so furiously toward a low ridge only 
a few rods away on the north, that the two men took 
their guns when they stepped out to reconnoiter. 
There was still no daylight, but the sky line showed 
faintly the ragged crest of the brush crowned bench. 
"Mr. Lee," said Lillywhite, "I see something mov- 
ing. Shall I fire ? ' ' Hail first, Joe, ' ' answered Mr. 
Lee, "for if it should be Indians, and we fire first, 
it will be said that we brought trouble on ourselves." 

Accordingly the young man hailed ; and for re- 
ply received a volley of bullets, one of which went 
through his right shoulder. He reeled and the gun 
fell from his helpless hand; but he staggered into 
the house before he fell. Mr. Lee, with other bul- 
lets singing past him, watched the young man till he 
gained cover; then fired one barrel of his shotgun 
at the place where he saw the flashes, and sprang 
into the house, forgetting to recover the rifle. 

The doors and windows had not yet all been 
opened. Such as were open were now hastily closed, 
just barely in time to prevent the entrance of the In- 
dians as they rushed yelling down the hill. 

The front or east door had only a wooden but- 
ton on a screw for a fastening, and the west one had 
a broken gimlet stuck nail-fashion into a small hole ; 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 233 

so that it was necessary to reinforce these frail fas- 
tenings with furniture. 

For the first few minutes the whoops and yells 
of the Indians, punctuated as they were with heavy 
blows on the doors and with shots through both 
doors and windows, were something terrific. The 
windows, fortunnately, had strong wooden shutters, 
secured with iron hooks on the inside. When these 
were all closed, the house would have been very dim 
had the sun been shining ; but now, just at the break 
of day, it was quite dark, and a tallow candle had 
to be lighted to enable Mr. Lee to reload the empty 
barrel of his shotgun. 

After raising such a hideous storm around the 
house for what seemed an age, the Indians grew 
quiet and one advanced to parley. During this lull 
in the strife, it may be well to introduce to the reader 
the remaining members of the household. 

Besides Mr. and Mrs. Lee and Mr. Lillywhite, 
there was a young daughter not quiet sixteen years 
old, who lived to become Mrs. Mary C. Black, now 
(A. D. 1914) a skillful apiarist resident in Fruita, 
Cal. Another daughter, twelve years old, who after- 
ward became the wife of Judge J. G. Sutherland, 
an eminent jurist in Salt Lake Ciy. Before her mar- 
riage, this lady had studied law, passed a successful 
examination and been admitted to practice before 
the bar. She was then Miss Emma Lee. 

Next was a son, Chas. A. Lee, an enterprising 
lad of nearly ten years, who is now an apiarist and 
orchadist in Fresno County, Cal. 

Next was a little daughter between seven and 
eight years old, now Mrs. Ellen L. Sanders, living 
in Nacozari, Sonora, Mexico. This lady is consid- 



234 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

ered to be one of Utah's foremost literary women. 

Last was Baby Rosamond, only fifteen months 
old, who is now Mrs. Geo. Sutherland, wife of the 
U. S. Senator from Utah. Besides these five child- 
ren of their own, there was a little English girl 
named Jane Hall, whose father had left her tempor- 
arily with the Lees while he went in search of a 
home and employment. She was about thirteen 
years old. These six children would have made a 
costly sacrifice to be offered up on the alter of 
redhanded violence. 

The Indian spokesman who hailed Mr. Lee by 
name, said that he was Too-witch-ee-Tick-a-boo* 
a very good friend, who was hungry. Would his 
friend John open the door and give him break- 
milk-matches, etc., Mr. Lee, after some talk, said 
to his wife, "We have always been such good friends 
with the Indians, can it be possible that all this is 
a mistake 1" "Not possible!" she replied "that all 
this shooting is any mistake." The Indian con- 
tinued to plead and protest until Mr. Lee said a,/ain 
to his wife, "I have so little ammunition that I can 
not fight long ; and when it is all gone, we should be 
at their mercy, and they would be still more an- 
gry than they are now. What do you think!" 

"I think just this: They are not angry at all 
have no occasion to be so. They have simply made 
up their minds to kill us. We will fight as long as 
there is one shot left, and trust in God. Let m 
answer once." "No," she called to the Indian, 
"you are not Tick-a-boo! We will not open the 
door! If you come in here, we will shoot you!" 

The Indian laughed, and said, "Oh! Squaw 
shoot! Now me scared! Yes, now me scared!"

Mr. Lee hastened to speak again lest the enemy 
suppose that the woman had spoken because he was 
disabled. 

Now the defenders learned the real reason for 
the stay of proceedings and the parley; for little 
puffs and lines of smoke began to come in between 
the roof and the walls of the unceiled rooms. The 
Indians had brought sagebrush and pushed bundles 
of it with poles up under the eaves, and fired them. 

Providentially, there had been snow sometime 
lately, and although the most of it was gone from 
sight, the roof of boards and slabs was so damp it 
would not blaze. The underside, with the burning 
brush against it, took fire but only smoudered, and 
poured into the rooms clouds of bitter smoke. It 
floated high for awhile, and then settled down like 
doom upon the defenseless inmates. It grew so 
dense that strangulation threatened ; and baby Eose 
gasped and struggled so that she seemed about to 
die. At one time some one discovered that under 
the best bed was better air, and Mary was appointed 
to take the child there and tend her. The other 
children stuck their heads into cupboards and even 
the dutch oven, and wherever they could find a little 
air. There was still a little water in the house, which 
was hoarded carefully. The wounded man contin- 
ously moaned for water, the baby drank eagerly, 
the others must have a few sips, and there was very 
little to spare for the fire, but that little was cautious- 
ly applied so as not to waste one precious drop. 

Emma had used some to make a cup of coffee 
for her father who dared not be off his guard for a 
single minute; and she had also given the children 
drinks of milk and bits of bread; but the parents 



236 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

had no time for eating. 

The smoke thickened till the wounded man 
groaned in distress ; and Charles, Emma and Janey 
Hall took turns in fanning him while they breathed 
through damp handkerchiefs, and coughed in a way 
that must have been music to the ears of their would- 
be murderers. Charles could even lift the head of 
the fallen youth to give him water, and did so until 
he was nearly as bloody as the patient. As the din 
increased, and more shots flew through the stifling 
smoke, Charles and Janey went together to the 
mother to ask what they could do to help. 

"You poor children," she answered, "there is 
nothing more you can do with your hands ; but you 
might pray with all your might for God in heaven to 
help us He only can ; ' ' and those two children knelt 
down amidst all that blood and smoke and uproar, 
and prayed with all the unstudied earnestness of 
trusting childhood ; and who shall say they were not 
heard? 

About this time some Indian inserted the tines 
of a pitchfork into the closing of the east door, and 
burst off the frail wooden button, but the cupboard 
barricade did not allow the door to open more than 
an inch or two. Here the darkness within gave Mr. 
Lee his first real advantage over his assailants. He 
haw, without pressing near enough to be seen, an 
Indian raising his gun to fire through the crevice; 
and he turned loose with the old shotgun at point 
blank range. 

A wild yell, followed by dreadful shrieks, groans 
nd howls, was the result of this, the second shot 
from the gun, which fairly tore away the right 
shoulder of the Indian. Almost immediately, Mr. 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 237 

Lee saw another Indian at a few rods distance ram* 
mmg a load into his gun. He sent the load fromt he 
other barrel after this besieger, and handed die gun 
to his wife to be reloaded; while with his revolver 
in hand, he continued his watch through that danger- 
ous but convenient opening. 

The Indian who received that last shot, had 
seemed to think he was out of range ; for when the 
charge struck him, he dropped his gun and sprang 
straight upward with a suppressed, guttural cry 
that seemed to express as much surprise as pain. By 
this time the Indians decided that they had no use 
for that narrow opening in the door, for the pitch- 
fork was cautiously removed ; and the besieged has- 
tened to drive in a stout nail. 

During this part of the action, Emma had found 
an ax in the kitchen and stationed herself by the 
west door, saying grimly that she would do her best 
to chop off a leg from the first Indian who came in 
there. Had the occasion and the moment been less 
tragic and desperate, this might have been amusing ; 
for she was a delicate girl and small for her age; 
but she meant it. 

Her mother smiled drearily at such training for 
a dainty girl, but her keenest anxiety in this terrible 
situation was for her daughter Mary. She found 
and gave to Mary a small dagger in a sheath at- 
tached to a narrow leather belt ; and while directing 
her to buckle it around her waist, said solemnly : 4 My 
daughter, our case is desperate; and if the worst 
comes, if the Indians do break in on us, your father, 
I and most likely all the rest of us except yourself 
will be killed at once ; but I fear they would take you 
alive and put you to tortures worse than death, as 



238 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



is their way with women prisoners. Let me beg you 
to wear this dagger and do not let them take you 
alive." 

Mary who had been so brave until now, almost 
fainted on hearing this; and, pale to the lipe, she 
sighed "Oh, I couldn't hurt a fly." Her mother 
urged her to be brave, and added, ' ' I wore that dag- 
ger through a time of danger " and Mary, with a 
great effort, put by her weakness and returned to her 
duties. 

The uproar on the outside gradually subsided; 
and the smoke on the inside thinned a little, probably 
being drawn up through the two chimneys. 

The besieged waited with straining ears to learn 
what new deviltry was to be practiced on them, while 
the slow minutes dragged along. The baby, pale 
and gasping, grew so weak and faint, that the mother 
in desperation took her to a west window which she 
opened enough to give the child a few breaths of 
outside air. The father ran in alarm to see what 
had happened; and on seeing the condition of the 
child, took up his guard there as long as they both 
dared. Then he said, "I will rush out and get 
water to drink and to throw on the fire." 

The wife protested earnestly, against this, so 
did the children. Mrs. Lee believed that the treach- 
erous foe had only pretended to go away, hoping to 
entice him, the only fighting man, to go on this very 
errand, so they might pick him off easily. "If he 
were killed," she urged, "the others very soon 
would be. ' ' 

He yielded to their entreaties; and Mrs. Lee, 
who was never known to flinch in the face of duty, 
and Mary, who had already concluded that an In-

MIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII1IIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIMIIIIIMIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIMIIIIIMI1II 

dian bullet would be far better than a dagger in 
her own hand, took buckets, and when the barricade 
had been removed from the back door, while the 
husband and father stood at guard for them, they 
ran to the stream, only a rod or two from the south 
end of the house, and secured water. 

The opening of the door (which was hastily bar- 
ricade again) released a volume of smoke, the 
water relieved their aching throats and smarting 
eyes, and with it they finally extinguished the fire. 
There had been no demonstration whatever from the 
enemy for nearly an hour; and hoping that the In- 
dians were really gone began to struggle with the 
fear of an ambuscade, when Charles came to his 
parents with a grave proposal that they allow him 
to run to town and ask for help. 

They were horrified at jthe bare thought of 
sending out so young a child to go eight miles on 
foot, more probably, to be shot down before their 
yes by their lurking foes. But the boy had the look 
of one inspired while he urged, "I know I can go 
and not be shot;" and said he would not follow the 
wagon road, which wound among the ridges, but 
would take a straight shoot across the country, 
which would shorten the way two miles or more. 

The parents then looked into each other's eyes 
and agreed without words. ' ' God is with the child, ' ' 
said the father, and laying his hands on the head of 
his grave little son, he solemnly blessed him. The 
mother kissed him just as solemnly, with all the dust 
and blood upon him. Then they opened the west 
window looking toward town and the boy sprang 
through and ran like a deer until lost to sight among 
the stunted cedars and sagebrush on the hillside. 



240 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



His father remained by the open window watch- 
ing for sign of an enemy until the flying figure 
disappeared. Then he closed the window and with 
his tired wife and weary children, prepared to face 
another interval of inaction and suspense. But just 
here, Janey raised a diversion by requesting Mr. and 
Mrs. Lee to let her also run away to Beaver. This 
they assured her they would never do. She was a 
girl nearly thirteen years old not even their own 
oh ! no ! that was not to be thought of not for one 
moment ! 

But the more they explained these things to 
Janey, the more persistent she grew, and the more 
fiercely she accused them of allowing one of their 
own to escape and save his life, while they kept her 
to be killed. After fifteen minutes to half an hour 
of screams and tears, and alternate entreaties and 
upbraidings from Janey, Mr. and Mrs. Lee decided 
that only God in heaven knew whether it were less 
dangerous to go or to stay ; and they let her go. 

Mr. Lee stood at the window as before to keep 
his futile watch over the child until she went out of 
his sight around the bend in the road. 

The sequel proved that at this very time the 
Indians were really gone to join their companions 
who were passing with droves of cattle; and happy 
would the Lees have been could they have known il. 

When Charles set out, he felt, as he said after- 
wards, as though he could fly. He fixed his eyes on 
a landmark and never went a round a rock or a bush, 
but leaped over them. He had no sense of fatigue 
until he reached the little suburb of Beaver which 
had been named Pleasant Point, but nicknamed 
Jackson County. There he saw Mr. Anderson just 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 241 

about to mount a horse to ride over to Beaver, about 
a mile distant. 

Seeing the boy all bloody and wild, he paused to 
make inquiry ; and the boy panted out, l ' The Indians 
fighting Hawthorne Dell. ' J 

"Poor boy," said Mr. Anderson, "Sit down 
here and rest and I'll stir up Beaver in a hurry." 

He mounted and galloped away, and the boy sat 
down on some timbers and felt like he never could 
move again. He had lost hat and shoes, scratched 
his flesh and torn his clothing to rags; but he had 
accomplished his errand in a marvelously short 
time. 

So did Mr. Anderson; for the boy was still 
sitting in the same place when a band of mounted 
men whom he had "scared up," passed on their 
way to Hawthorne Dell. They shouted "Hello 
Bub," but never drew rein. Near Birch Creek, 
about half the distance to the ranch, they met Janey 
Hall, who, to their surprise, did not seem frightened 
nor excited, but was walking leisurely along the 
road, and chewing gum that she had picked by the 
way. They greeted her and passed on, and she fin- 
ished her long walk alone but safely. 

When the horsemen reached the ranch, sometime 
before noon, they found no Indians, but scouted 
about and found plenty of signs. Patches of frothy 
blood on the top of the ridge whence came the shot 
that brought down young Lilywhite before he had 
a chance to fire once ; other blood on the ground east 
of the house, and indoors, too. The dropped rifle 
was found and utterly ruined, and with its magazine 
quite empty. Harness, saddles, tools and many other 
things were destroyed, all the horse and cattle in- 



242 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

closures were left empty, and untold damage done; 
but of the nine persons beseiged only one had been 
hurt, and the grain stacks were safely standing. For 
these mercies Mr. Lee was a thankful man. 

A few of the men remained to assist the family 
while the others pushed on after the Indians. 

It did not take those on the trail very long to 
understand the situation. The range was silent and 
empty, and the fat young cattle found shot along 
the trail, told them the whole story. They knew that 
the relations between this family and their Indian 
neighbors had always been friendly, therefore it 
was highly improbable that this attack had any per- 
sonal ill will behind it; but was made solely because 
the little ranch lay in the track the Indians wanted to 
use in a great cattle raid. Although they must have 
known that the family was hurrying to get away for 
the winter, they could not postpone the raid because 
they also knew the white men were preparing for an 
extensive roundup, and they, the Indians wished to 
be beforehand. 

These men followed the Indians and cattle sixty 
or more miles without overtaking them, swift as 
they had been to follow. There they were forced to 
turn back because their hasty preparations were so 
inadequate to a long march or for a hard fight. 

At the farm the great concern was to get the 
wounded man and the family away before night. The 
team was gone, the harness demolished, the wagon 
heaped up with potatoes ; and the only vehicle that 
had come from town was a very light buggy belong- 
ing to Bishop E. Murdock. This could not even 
convey the wounded man, who was too weak from 
loss of blood to sit erect. Just here the meinorv of

Mrs. Lee (now 84 years old) under whose sanction 
and prompting this chronicle is made, fails her; 
and the pen woman, who was not an eyewitness, 
supplies from impressions received at the time this 
one statement, believed but not guaranteed to be 
true. 

A good brother named Alonzo Colton, from 
Miners vile, was on his way to a sawmill farther up 
in the mountains to get a load of lumber. He arrived 
at Hawthorne Dell when it began to look as if there 
was nothing to do but to send to Beaver for convey- 
ance and await its coming, a most dread alternative. 
On hearing of the dilemma, Mr. Colton promptly un- 
hitched his team, and leaving his ^running gear" 
standing, hitched on to Mr. Lee 's wagon, from which 
the potatoes were hastily "dumped." The sick man 
in his bed and the wife and children were then load- 
ed in, and Mr. Colton himself drove them down the 
mountain road to their home, where they arrived at 
about five o 'clock, p. m. 

Now if this statement be not correct, Mr. Col- 
ton or any surviving member of his family is at 
liberty to deny it; and she who wrongfully accuses 
him stands ready to apologize amply. One thing, 
however, that she knows to be a fact, is that when, 
some days later, threshing was done, this same Mr. 
Colton with his own wagon and team brought down 
one or more loads of the crop, and never would ac- 
cept one cent of pay. For this kindness to fellow- 
creatures in distress, he is gratefully remembered 
to this day; also others who freely rendered assist- 
ance at a time of need. 

This murderous and unprovoked attack took 
place on the 23rd of October, A. D. 1866. Mr. Lee, 



244 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

Who is not now living, always considered it a divine 
intervention that prompted him to put his fire-arms 
into good condition just on the eve of such dire 
need. He fired only three shot, (having no ammuni- 
tion to waste), but every one reached its mark. The 
Indians at the time made themselves scarce, and 
knew absolutely nothing; but in after years they 
said Mr. Lee was a Big Chief a Brave and that 
he had killed three bad Indians who had tried to kill 
him. These were the Piutes, whose home was in Bea- 
ver County, and who knew every member of Mr. 
Lee 's family well, and often visited them at the farm. 
It is even probable that the very matches used to fire 
the dwelling had been begged from the intended 
victims. One queer thing not yet mentioned is that 
when the east door of the house was finally opened, 
it was found piled high with sagebrush that had not 
been fired; and after much wonder why this dry 
door was left unburned while the wet roof had so 
much effort spent on it in vain, the conclusion was 
finally reached that after the brush was heaped 
against the door, the Indians found they had used 
all their matches. If so, it was certainly an error of 
judgment on their part, because the door would have 
burned readily. 

Joseph Lillywhite recovered from his wound; 
but it is said that he never became the strong man 
that his robust youth promised, and did not live to 
reach middle age. 

Such were many of the experiences of the early 
settlers of Utah.

ACCOUNT OF THE WAR IN WASATCH COUNTY 
AND VICINITY. 

Wasatch County, Utah, which was somewhat ad- 
jacent to the Indian rendezvous in the DuChesne 
country had its share of Indian troubles during the 
Black Hawk war in 1866. The following from the 
writing of John Crook of Heber City : 

In the early spring of 1866, instructions came 
from military headquarters, Salt Lake City to pre- 
pare for Indian troubles, and to guard our stock and 
vicinity, and we were informed that officials would 
arrive to organize us and place us on a war footing. 

In the month of April, 1866, we began to build 
corrals for our dry-stock in Eoss Hollow, eight miles 
north, and also a large corral in Heber City for the 
cow-herd. 

On the 25th of May, 1866, Col. Robert T. Bur- 
ton and Drill Sergeant D. G. Eoss arrived, and or- 
ganized the militia in the valley, with John W. Witt 
as Major and Charles H. Wilkins as adjutant of 
company (A) " cavalry. " Company (D) was com- 
posed of Silver Grays, and these two companies 
formed the first Battalion. 

Companies B and C formed the second battal- 
ios, and was commasded by John Ha.rm1f.fm as 
major and John Crook as adjutant. 

All on the west side of the Provo Eiver prin- 
cipally Midway formed a separate command, a bat- 
talion, with Sidney H. Epperson as major and 
David Van Wagonen as adjutant, this company con- 
sisted of both cavalry and infantry. 



246 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



All the settlers on the east side of the Provo 
River moved to Heber City. On the 25th and 26th 
of May a two days drill was ordered, and a sham 
battle was participated in on which occasion Col. 
Robert T. Burton called the troops into a hollow 
square. This being done Col. Burton said, "Now 
you are organized on a war footing, go to work 
and put out your guards and scouts, and protect 
yourselves.'' 

The previous winter had been a very severe 
one, and with deep snow in the mountains we did 
not expect that the Indians would come over so 
soon. 

FIRST INDIAN RAID. 

About the middle of May, 1866, a band of In- 
dians came over the mountains, no doubt in the 
night, the snow being crusted. They gathered up 
some forty or fifty head of stock on the east range, 
and drove them over no doubt while the snow was 
yet crusted. Wm. McDonald while hunting cattle 
came across the trail. Adjutant Wilkins and Lieuten- 
ant McDonald started with a posse of men in pursuit 
and reached the trail in the middle of the day. The 
snow being soft the horses plunged to their bellies 
and the expedition had to give up the chase and 
return home. Wm. Bradley Sessions who had a 
big family lost seven cows in this raid, the Indians 
taking all he had. This raid was made before the 
county militia was organized. 

For information I will describe the lay of the 
country. Three canyons leads from Provo Valley to 
the dividing ridge between said valley and the In- 
dian Reservation. The center one is Lake Creek 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIOHS 247 



iiiMiiiiiimiuiMiimiilif minium 



running due east, through this canyon an Indian 
trail leads over into the west fork of the Duchesne 
River, and it was only forty miles from Heber to 
the Indian colony on said river by way of this trail. 

After re-organization of the militia we placed 
guards, "The Silver Grays," on the north 
and south of Main Street in Heber City and a 
guard at the grit mill, one mile east, also three 
sets of scouts for the three canyons, patrolling the 
ridge between the Reservation and Provo Vallyy. 
They were on duty both day and night, and were 
changed every four days. 

On the 27th of May an expedition started to the 
Uintah Indian Reservation. Col. Head, the Indian 
agent, was along with Col. Robert T. Burton and 
Sergeant Ross, with supplies for the Indiass ; there 
were also three men with one hundred head of beef 
cattle for the Indians, a present from Brigham 
Young (church donation) Col. Head asking for an 
escort of the militia, the following were chosen to 
compose the escort. 

Captain Wm. M. Wall, Lieut. Joseph McDonald, 
Serg't John McDonald; Privates: John J. Cum- 
mings, Wm. B. Sessions, Hyrum Oakes, Joseph Mc- 
Carrol, George Boner, Nymphus C. Murdock, Wil- 
liam Forman, Stanley Davis, Steven Taylor of Salt 
Lake City, Alma Huntington, George Carlile. The 
expedition was gone twelve days. 

The personnel of a Second Platoon composing 
the escort is the following: 

Lieut. Patrick Caroll, Serg't Edward Brunson 
Privates : Wm. Giles, Jr., Eph. Van Wagenon, Jerry 
Robey, Zeke Bates, Emanuel Richman, James Carlile, 
John Acomb, Stephen Moore. Teams and teamsters : 



248 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

N. C. Murdock's team, Ben. A. Norris, driver, John 
W. Witts team, Willard Carroll driver, Hyrum 
Oakes, team, Isaac 0. Wall, driver. 

This Platoon and outfit was gone ten days. 
They were corralled four day in a log cabin sur- 
rounded by three hundred "to-buck" (angry) In- 
dians, who didn't want the cattle but wanted Mor- 
mon scalps. The agent prevailed on the Indians to 
let them go. 

On July 8th, 1866, a second expedition was sent 
to the reservation with Indian supplies. 

Following are the names of the parties, con- 
stituting this expedition : 

Major John Hamilton, Lieut. Joseph McCarroll 
(infantry), Adjutant Charles WilMn, Capt. Wm. M. 
Wall, lieut. Wm. McDonald, and Privates Nym- 
phus C. Murdock, George Giles (blacksmith) William 
Gallagher, Joseph Thomas, George F. Giles, Henry 
Luke (interpreter) Albert McMullen, John Harvey, 
Jr., James Allred, Richard Jones, Wm. M. Giles, Mo- 
roni Duke, James Shanks, commissary for the expe- 
dition and Privates Ira N. Jacobs, George Boner, 
James B. Hamilton, A. Thompson and Emanuel 
Richman (teamster.) 

This expedition numbering 23 men was gone 
eight days, from the 8th to the 16th of July. 

While this party was over at the Reservation 
a raid was made on Thomas Handley's corral, in 
Heber City, where Indians took two oxen and a hei- 
fer. 

This raid will be explained as the raid in which 
Jas. A. Ross and others figured. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 249 



SECOND RAID ON STOCK. 

After the second expedition had started for the 
Reservation and while the expedition was still there 
between the 8th and 16th of July, 1866, some Indians 
came into the eastern part of Heber and took two 
oxen and a heifer from Tom. Handley 's corral ; they 
left a bell-cow. William Foreman, who was on guard 
at the lake, found the tracks at daylight. A shower 
having fallen during the night he rushed to Heber 
and reported. Handley *s stock being found miss- 
ing, James A. Eoss, Joseph S. Parker, Sid Carter 
and Isaac Cummings started in a hurry on the trail 
and when down about eight miles on the west Du- 
chesne they saw smoke in the timber. Leaving their 
horses and crawling up close to the timber, they 
saw the Indians roasting meat, they having killed 
the heifer. One Indian was sitting on the paunch 
while the others were lying down. By signs each 
of the men in pursuit took aim at an object and 
fired. The Indian on the paunch fell over and the 
others crawled into the brush. The boys got the 
oxen and also the Indians' horses and effects and 
some of the meat, which they brought home, and 
they did not look to see how many Indians were 
killed. 

This occurred when the militia was at the Res- 
ervation. Lieutenant McDonald was conversing- 
with some Indians when another Indian rode up 
very excited pointing to the hills and motioned for 
another horse. It was rumored that a wounded In- 
dian was brougt in before the company left. Putting' 
these items together, they tally with circumstan- 



250 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



ces connected with the raid on Mr. Handley's cattle 
at that time. 

By request of Commander James D. Shanks. 
Adjutant Lindsey sends an account of an incident 
which happened in conection with the second expedi- 
tion from Provo Valley. After delivering the sup- 
plies to the Indians, part of the company decided 
to come back to Heber by way of the short cut, or 
Indian trail. Captain Wm. M. Wall, Charles H. 
Wilcken, Nymphus C. Murdock, George Bonner, Jos. 
McCarrel, Ira Jacobs and Wm. Gallagher and two 
or three others were in this company. This route 
led them down Lake Creek Canyon which is east of 
Heber and runs to the ridge between this Valley and 
the old Reservation, scouts were kept on this ridge 
all through the summer. The day before these men 
came over the ridge the scouts came to Heber and re- 
ported that they had seen Indians encamped in a 
grove near the head of Lake Creek. 

Twelve men on foot were sent out that night 
with orders to get well up into the canyon before day 
light to surround the Indians. They reached the 
appointed place by nine or ten o 'clock a. m. and exa- 
mined the grove. They saw no Indians, but found a 
fresh trail leading down towards Heber. 

This company consisted of W. B. Sessions, Isaac 
Baum, John and Geo. Muir, Jesse Bond, Lewis Mec- 
ham, Thos. Handley, G. A. Wilson, Dickson Green 
and three others. After following the trail three 
miles, they came onto what they supposed were In- 
dians, lying in a sort of grassy and shadj- place, and 
without waiting for orders two of the men fired. The 
result was that N. C. Murdock was grazed by a 
Imllet on his left wrist and shot in the right leg. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 251

The bullet shattering the shin bone. George Bonner 
was shot through the thigh, the bullet coming so near 
through that it was cut out with a pocket knife. 

Wm. M. Wall had a marvelous escape, a bullet 
passed around the rim of his belly, making nine holes 
in his vest and shirt, but never breaking his skin. 
It has always been considered a miracle that Cap- 
tain Wall was not killed. It was also through the 
alertness of our scouts just a few days before, that 
J. A. Boss and three companions were able to over- 
take those three Indians who took Thomas Handley's 
oxen and heifer out of his corral, right in Heber, and 
they brought back the oxen and the Indians ' horses, 
also a white mule that had been stolen by the Indians 
down on the Sevier River. 

One Indian was known to have been killed at 
the time, and another wounded; one got away.

time. 

THIRD RAID. 

About August, Indians took John Muir's mules 
and John Turner's horses out of a pasture adjoining 
Heber City east. Through friendly Indians Mr. Tur- 
ner got back his horses, but Mr. Muir's mules, two 
fine ones, failed to return. 

FOURTH RAID. 

About the 20th of August Indians took John 
Lee's horses from his pasture, one mile east of 
Heber City. Mr. Lee had moved from his farm to 
the east line of the city, and had just taken the 



252 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



animals to the pasture, when on looking east, 
he saw the Indians driving the horses out of the pas- 
ture. He gave the alarm. The Indians drove the 
horses along the foot hills, east and north aiming to 
strike the Park City road north of Heber. A com- 
pany of men started to head them off. William Mc- 
Donald who lived on his farm on said road and 
owned a good horse, mounted this horse bare back 
and started in pursuit, but the Indians struck the 
road before Mr. McDonald. A race ensued, but be- 
fore Mr McDonald could reach the river bridge six 
miles north, the Indians ran the horses across the 
Provo River and into some brush where they left 
them, and then hurried away. 

The boys brought the horses back. About ten 
days later the Indians stole the same horses again, 
out of the same pasture. On this occasion Mr. Lee 
got one horse back by paying an Indian for getting 
it. 

FIFTH RAID. 

In September, 1866, the Indians broke into Wm. 
BelPs stable south of Heber and stole a fine pair 
of mares "called Island stock ". These animals 
were young and full of life, and had not been han- 
dled much. It appeared that the Indians had had 
a struggle with them in the sage brush. The next 
morning they were found shot. About this time, or 
perhaps a little later, Charles H. Wilkin went to his 
saw-mill in Center Creek canyon with two yoke of 
oxen, which he turned out in the evening. The next 
morning they were gone. Major Witt and Adj't. 
Wilkin went to the Reservation and got three of 
them back; one had been killed and eaten. It was 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 253 

quite a risk for these two men to go on such, an 
expedition alone. 

From a report filed Oct. 8th, 1866, by Major 
John Hamilton, who was in command, we learn that 
Indians had stolen some horses from stables in the 
south part of Heber City, and had driven them 
south, following a ridge to the river. Thence up a 
canyon over the ridge, thence into American Fork 
Canyon, and thence down to the north end of Utah 
Lake, across Jordan Bridge and thence into Cedar 
Valley, going west. 

A company of sixteen started in pursuit and 
when they reached the Jordan Bridge they learned 
that the Indians had crossed there before day-light. 
The boys followed the thieves into Cedar Valley and 
met some teams hauling wood. The wood-haulers 
said that they had seen some Indians and horses 
two hours previous on the run. As the pursuers 
realized that they were at least two hours behind 
the Indians they concluded that following further 
would be a fruitless chase, as the Indians before 
they could be overtaken would be on their own 
grounds and the horses hidden away. It was there- 
fore decided to give up the chase, and the boys con- 
sequently returned to their homes. 

Following are the names of those who partici- 
pated in this expedition: 

Major John Hamilton, Capt. Wm. M. Watt, 
Lieutenants James A. Ross and Patrick Carroll, 
Sergeants Philip L. Smith and Geo. A. Wilson and 
Privates John Acomb, Joseph Parker, A. McMullen, 
Sol. Sessions, Geo. F. Giles, Wm. Gallagher, Wm. 
M. Giles, Orson Hicken, Bobt. Broadhead and Frank 
Fraughton.

ACCOUNT OF THE WAR IN WASATCH 
COUNTY CONTINUED. 

The spring of 1867 was late and the snow deep 
in the hills. We pnt out our guards, but no Indians 
troubled us until about the middle of July. We had 
a special scout independent of the usual scouts, 
namely John Cummirigs, who on a certain occasion 
found in a side Canyon an Indian who had skinned 
an ox and was in the act of cutting up the meat. 
Mr. Cummings covered the Indian with his rifle 
and drove him ahead of him to Heber City where he 
was kept under guard three days. A court marshal 
decided to write a note to Chief Tabby, advising 
him to keep his Indian at home, and also asking 
Tabby to come over and make peace with us. We 
gave the note to the Indian and told him to go im- 
mediately to the Reservation, give the note to Chief 
Tabby like a good Indian. Two guards went with 
him to see him over the ridge. 

About a month later, or about the 15th or 20th 
of August, Chief Tabby with his whole tribe, squaws, 
pappoosses and peaceable Indians that he could 
control came here. The Chief said that he could 
not control those of his Indians who were with 
Black Hawk. We had a bowery in which we held 
summer meetings, and in this we set large tables, 
and the ladies furnished a good picnic for the 
Indians. An ox was killed and roasted, (a fine 
barbeque) and the Indians filled up good; the pipe 
of peace was passed around, and the Indians 
after stopping a few days returned home with a 
few good presents. On leaving our valley these In- 
dians stole thirty of our horses. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 255 

This occurrence ended the raids in our valley, 
and we still kept up our guards and scouts in the 
hills. 

Concerning further Indian troubles in Wasatch 
County in 1867 John Crook wrote the following: 

The expeditions reported in the foregoing de- 
tails are from the original records in charge of 
John Crook who was adjutant to Major John Ham- 
ilton at the time. Other information is from par- 
ties who took part in the different expeditions and 
from personal knowledge and memory. The guards 
and scouts were mostly from the infantry and 
the Silver Grays. The cavalry was kept as min- 
ute men to be ready to go at a minute's notice. 
There were about 260 men enrolled in the militia 
in Provo Valley. At this time (1914) the sur- 
vivors are reduced to about thirty-five. 

I have written this by an order and sanction 
of the Veterans and they pronounce it O. K. this 
7th day of November, 1914. John Crook. 

COL. PIERCE AND ANDREWS ENGAGE 
INDIANS NEAR ST. GEORGE. , 

Early in January 1867 the Navajoes made a 
raid on the horse herd in Washington County. This 
being just after New Year, it was an intimation of 
what might be expected in other places ; in this in- 
stance however, the success of the savages was of 
short duration. Captain James Andrus led a party 
of Saint George cavalry in pursuit, overtook the 
thieves, killed eleven of them and recovered the 
horses. 



256 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



RAID ON PINE VALLEY, INDIANS OVERTAKEN, 
ELEVEN KILLED. 

From David Chidester the following additional 
particulars are obtained. On the night of Jan. 18th, 
1867, the Navajo and some Shevete Indians gathered 
stock from Shoal Creek down along Black Ridge. 
When Col. J. D. L. Pierce and his company found the 
tracks, they followed them to the end of the ridge, 
some ten or fifteen miles. The militia kept in a 
wash as much as possible, and saw in the distance 
what appeared to be a small whirl-wind, but which 
proved to be smoke from the Indians camp-fire. 
The cavalry came upon the Indians unawares, and 
killed twelve of them and put the rest to flight; 
they recovered nearly all the stock, about two hun- 
dred head, but some of the Indians had separated 
were seen, but not found. While the fight was in 
from the rest, as the tracks of two large mules 
progress the stock started back the way they came, 
and were not overtaken till they had preceded about 
six miles. 

As spring advanced Black-Hawk and his band 
from the Elk Mountains region made, their way 
northward. In March, 1867, General Snow was in 
Glenwood confined to his bed with sickness, and the 
people were not looking for trouble with the Indians 
so early in the season. However, they were prepar- 
ing for future trouble by building a rock fort about 
two miles west of Glenwood, which was considered 
a safer place than Glenwood, being farther away 
from the mountains, or out in the open valley, but the 
location was not good, as it was low land and without

drainage, and surrounded by springs and swamps. 
Yet the town being so near the hills was too much 
exposed for safety; hence, the move. The Fort, 
however, was never finished. 

J. P. PETERSEN, WIFE AND MARY SMITH 

KILLED NEAR GLENWOOD. 
A SKIRMISH AT GLENWOOD, STOCK 
RECOVERED. 

Early in the morning of March 21, 1867, Jens 
Peter Peters en and wife, and Mary Smith, a neigh- 
bor girl, aged fourteen years, left Richfield, Sevier 
County to go to Glenwood about five miles distant 
(east) with an ox-team to do some trading. Stores 
being few in those days. Warren S. Snow had 
brought a load of merchandise to Glenwood to trade 
for stock and produce, and in order to get some 
needed articles, these people ventured out, think- 
ing that by starting so early in the day there would 
be no danger, but as the roads were muddy, they 
could not travel as fast they had expected. It may 
here be added that it was contrary to council at 
this time for anyone to travel between the settle- 
ments without armed escort. The Petersens left 
their baby girl, eighteen months old, at Jorgen 
Smith's at Richfield; she is now Mrs. Christine 
Christensen of Koosharem, and mother-in-law of 
Louis Hatch (the Indian Missionary). When they 
got to the so-called Black Ridge east of the Sevier 
River, Indians were gathering the stock along the 
river bottoms; and the Indians seeing the people 
on the road, immediately attacked them and killed all 
of them, mutilating their bodies in a most horrible 



258 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

manner, especially the women; they also killed one 
of their oxen. Just at that time two boys from 
Glenwood, Joseph Hendricksen and Joseph Frankum 
happened to be down in the field near by after some 
cows. They had some difficulty in starting the 
animals and looking back they saw two persons com- 
ing down the dugway. One of the boys said to the 
other: " There comes some boys, we will ask them 
to help us to start the cows." But they soon dis- 
covered they were Indians and then ran for town, 
The Indians squatted down and took a shot at them, 
but missed their mark. Hendricksen reached town 
first and reported. The murderers drove the stock 
which they had gathered north to the crossing of 
Cove River, near the so-called Herrings Hole. The 
stream being difficult to cross, they were delayed 
somewhat in getting the stock over. Some of the 
men in town requested that no one should leave the 
settlement lest the Indians should come and over- 
power the people. But when Dr. Elias Pearson, 
called for men to follow him, ten or more responded 
among whom were the following : Dr. Pearson, Arte- 
mus Millett, James Killion, J. K. Petersen, Joseph 
Snow (son of General Snow), Archibald T. Oldroyd, 
Joseph Herring, George Pectol, J. K. P. Sampson, 
and Hans J. Gottfredson (a boy who was on his 
way to work on the fort) Some of these men got 
between the stock and the hills, and exchanged sev- 
eral shots with the savages; and the Indians who 
would not fight in the open, made for the hills and 
rocks. One redskin endeavored to stampede the 
stock by shouting and shaking his blanket, and 
two or three others were hiding among the cattle, 
but the stock did not seem to scare much on this oc- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 259 



casion. The Indian with the blanket was wounded 
and ran to the hills, and the savages reached a 
creek later called Indian creek, where they made a 
stand and fought for some time. It was amusing 
to see J. K. Peterson maneuver, he would dodge 
around here and there and when he saw an oppor- 
tunity he would squat down and fire, throw himself 
down on his back, while reloading, and get up again 
to repeat the performances. Some of the men kept 
the Indians back, while the younger boys drove the 
stock to town. About a dozen men came out from 
town to meet those who had been out and helped 
to r drive the stock in. Some Indians rode out onto 
the point of the hill, and the white horse Chief 
' ' Shena- vegan. ' ' rode around encouraging his braves 
The boys picked him out for a target and ran him to 
cover. John Frankum, whose gun was out of com- 
mission, obtained another gun from a boy (Tom 
Goff ) and together with some others went up to- 
wards the Indians on the hill. Here Frankum was 
shot through one shoulder which disabled him, but 
Hans. J. Gottfredson assisted him to reach town. The 
Indians finally pulled off into the hills, but got away 
with a few horses and a mule or two. One of the 
mules belonging to Peter Oldroyd. It was recovered 
at the Spring City fight the next fall. 

After the skirmish and recovery of the stock, 
George Crowther of Monroe, who had been working 
on the Glenwood Fort for Peter Oldroyd, started for 
home. Archibald T. Oldroyd and some of the other 
boys who had been in the fight started with him to 
escort him part way, and when they reached the dug- 
way on the hill near Glenwood they found the wagon, 
and the murdered people. It appeared that when the 



260 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



Indians had shot the ox, the people jumped from the 
wagon and started to run. Petersen had gone but a 
short distance from the wagon when he was shot 
down. After being shot he had been horribly beaten 
about the head and face ; his nose was mashed onto 
the side of his face, and he was scalped. Mrs. Peter- 
sen who was in a delicate condition had run a short 
distance up the road. Miss Mary Smith being young, 
had nearly reached the top of the hill before she was 
overtaken. Both women were stripped and horribly 
mutilated. Before George Crowther and his escort 
left the scene of the tragedy, they were joined by a 
company of men from Richfield. One of the party 
was sent back to Richfield after a conveyance to 
take the dead people home. 

At the time of the killing of the people on Black 
Ridge, Ole P. Bork, a Richfield harness maker, then 
a boy, was going down into the meadows to look 
for stock. Just at sunrise he heard shooting; the 
air was a little hazy, but he could see that the shoot- 
ing was done by Indians, and knowing also that 
Petersen had gone to Glenwood, he thought the In- 
dians were after them. He therefore ran for town, 
but when about half way to the settlement a man on 
horse-back (who had been down at the river) passed 
him and gave the alarm. The drum beat, and when 
Borg got to the fort at Richfield a number of men 
had already started for the scene, but arrived there 
too late to render much assstance. The Smith family 
claimed the little girl who had been left with them, 
as their daugther had been killed, but Major Glaus 
P. Anderson who was a relative claimed her, and 
raised her to womanhood. 

Ten of the Richfield boys participated in the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 261 



expedition named. They were ordered to go to the 
upper, or south end, of the Black Ridge and follow 
down the same. When they came to the place where 
the people were killed they met the Glenwood boys. 
Some of both parties (Joe Snow with them) went 
after the Indians; they traveled up Indian Creek, 
the way the Indians had gone, and followed the trial 
to the head of Lost Creek, where they abandoned the 
chase and returned. 

SEVIER, PIUTE AND PARTS OF OTHER 
COUNTIES VACATED. 

Richfield as well as Monroe and Glenwood were 
vacated April 20, 1867, by their inhabitants because 
of the Indian troubles. About the same time many 
other places were temporarily deserted. Thus Piute 
County was entirely vacated as well as the settle- 
ments of Berryville, Windsor, upper and lower 
Kanab, Shunesburg and Northup and many ranches 
in Kane County ; and so also were the settlements of 
Panguitch and Fort Sanford in Iron County. 

These timely movements undoubtedly saved many 
Kves, for the hostility and strength of the savages 
left no doubt as to their determination on aggressive 
measures. Troops were accordingly mustered into 
service in the counties of Sanpete, Juab, and Utah. 

GEN. R. T. BURTON AND COMMAND ORDERED 
TO SANPETE. 

April 15th, 1867, General .Daniel H. WeUs 
called upon Major-General Robert T. Burton of Salt 
Lake County to raise three platoons of cavalry to 



262 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



march on the 22nd for Sanpete; this detachment 
numbering seventy-two men, under command of Cap- 
tain Orson P. Miles reported to General Pace at 
Provo who had been appointed to succeed General 
Snow in command of the Sanpete district. 

CAPT. WM. L. BINDER'S INFANTRY LEFT 

S. L. CITY FOR SANPETE. 

ADAM PAUL OF CAPT. MILES CAVALRY 

COMPANY WOUNDED. 

On the 22nd of April 1867, Captain William L. 
Binder left Salt Lake City with a small company of 
infantry and reported for duty to General Pace, 
whose headquarters had been established at Gunni- 
son; General Pace's own district. Utah County had 
also sent a company of cavalry under Captain F. P. 
Whitmore and one of infantry to the front. With 
these reinforcements and the energetic preparations 
made by local troops it was hoped that the savages 
might be deterred from further depredations. 

An engagement occurred in May 11, 1867 in 
which Adam Paul of Mile's Salt Lake cavalry was 
wounded. 

ATTACK ON FOUNTAIN GREEN COWHERD 
LOUIS LUND KILLED. 

At Fountain Green, Sanpete County, it was cus- 
tomary for a guard of ten men to be with the cow- 
herd, but in the morning of June 1st, 1867, only five 
were with it, and Mathew Caldwell, the man in 
charge of the guard, was detained in the settlement 
and getting his horse shod. Feed being plentiful, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 263 

the herd only went a short distance from town to 
graze. Two of the herders were stationed a short 
distance east of the herd on a knoll where their 
horses were feeding just below. The other three 
herders were on the north. Wm. Adams, Jr., who 
happened to be in the edge of town saw ten per- 
sons riding fast from the east hills towards the herd. 
Thinking they were the ten herds-men he took no 
more notice of it until he heard shooting in the 
direction of the herd; then he was convinced that 
the men he had seen were Indians. Before the 
Indians reached the herd, they separated, six going 
east and the other four west of the herd. Jasper 
Robertson, Swen Anderson and Louis Lund who 
were north of the herd, had killed some rabbits 
and were cleaning them in a hollow by the water 
hollow ditch, and did not know anything about the 
presence of Indians until the savages rode to the 
brink of the hollow and shot Lund through the re- 
gion of the heart. He immediately fell forward into 
the water, and the other two jumped up and ran. 
Jasper Robertson was shot through the thigh, while 
Anderson escaped unhurt. Albert Col!ard and Char- 
les Jones, who were on the east of the herd, heard 
the shooting and ran toward the place where their 
horses were. The Indians tried to head them off, 
but the boys had the start and were not overtaken. 
W. H. Adams and Thomas Caldwell, hearing the 
shooting, thought it was the boys and Indians fight- 
ing, and they mounted their horses and went to the 
scene of action as speedily as they could. When 
they got about two miles from town they saw cat- 
tle which had been shot along the trail on which 



264 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



the Indians were driving the herd. They followed 
the herd to the pass that leads over into Water Hol- 
low, and thinking it unsafe to follow farther they 
returned. William G. Caldwell, a boy was taking 
an old mare to the herd, seeing the Indians, turned 
and rode for town. Some of the Indians tried to 
head him off and shot at him several times, but 
he escaped unhurt and gave the report in town. As 
Adams and Caldwell were returning, after follow- 
ing the Indians, they saw two men, Noah T. Guyman 
and Charles Johnson, and on reaching them they 
were informed that Louis Lund had been killed some- 
where on the Water Hollow Ditch, but they could not 
find him. But as Adams knew where the first shoot- 
ing had been done, they soon located him and found 
him lying with his head in the ditch with the water 
running through his hair. He had also been shot 
in the center of the forehead at short range, his 
face being powder-burned. Adams and Caldwell 
carried the body out of the hollow and by this time 
others had arrived. Most horses are frightened at 
the smell of blood, and as Adams had a gentle 
horse and Parley Allred had a saddle on his horse, 
they took the saddle off and put it on Adams' gen- 
tle horse, placed the corpse in it in an upright posi- 
tion, and with Swen Anderson walking on one side 
and Adams on the other they held in it the saddle 
until they reached the edge of town, where they 
met Thomas Crowder with a wagon. They then 
placed the body in the wagon and took it to the 
fort, only about two hundred yards distant. Bro. 
Lund's body was taken to his mother's room; he 
was her only child. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 265 



As soon as possible a company of men followed 
the Indians who were driving away two hundred 
head of stock and horses belonging to the settlers. 
On reaching Thistle Valley they met Colonel John 
L. Ivie and his company of cavalry from Mount 
Pleasant and together they now followed the In- 
dians and soon captured the cattle, but the Indians 
who had changed horses and were riding fresh 
horses belonging to the settlers hurried away, know- 
ing that they were pursued. They rushed the horses 
into Spanish Fork Canyon and got away with forty 
head. 

Col. Eeddick N. Allred gives the following par- 
ticulars of the Fountain Green tragedy. 

Springtown, June 12th, 1867. 
Editor Deseret News: 

In regard to the Indian raid at Fountain Green, 
some people may wonder why forty-five men, com- 
iug up with twenty-one Indians could not kill or 
cap line them and recover the stock, we were led 
to believe, from the report of the express riders and 
telegram from Moroni, that twelve Indians had 
gone with the stock, and that a war party was left 
behind fighting for two hours. On learning this, 
and that Major Bradley had sent assistance, I raised 
fourteen men from Springtown and followed Col. 
Ivie as fast as I could to Thistle Valley, to inter- 
cept the Indians. He (Col. Ivie) arrived in Thistle 
valley with twenty-three men from Mount Pleasant 
and Fairview, and saw the Indians about three miles 
distant, and near the canyon. Finding themselves 



266 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

hard pressed they killed and wounded some of the 
cattle, mounted fresh animals, driving only horses 
before them and reached the canyon before Col. 
Ivie came up. He took the precaution to flank 
the canyon, not knowing but that a heavy re- 
serve was lying in wait. In a few moments he be- 
came satisfied that twelve Indians were about the 
whole number in the canyon, but supposed that the 
war party was still behind, and kept a rear guard 
to watch for them. That guard twice reported In- 
dians in the rear, but they proved to be our re-in- 
forcements. Col. Ivie pursued the Indians about 
three miles, into the mountains, but finding that 
their jaded horses were unable to compete with the 
fresh horses that the Indians had just mounted, 
they gave up the chase. I formed a junction with 
Maj. Guyman and twenty- three men from Fountain 
Green and Moroni, in the south end of Thistle Val- 
ley, and met Col. Ivie at the mouth of the canyon. 
After hearing his report I decided to return. The 
distance our men had to travel was from fifteen to 
thirty miles, which was done on the run, I believe 
that the officers and men generally did their best 
in trying to capture the raiders, but the want of 
vigilance on the part of the guards gave them the 
advantage ; and the want of telegraph office in each 
settlement was all that prevented us from cutting 
them off. The distance rode from the point of at- 
tack till I met Col. Ivie was at least fifty miles. 

Yours, 

R. N. Allred.

MAJOR VANCE AND SOT. HOUTZ KILLED AT 
TWELVE MILE CREEK. 

On the 2nd of June, 1867, Major John W. Vance 
(of Alpine, Utah County) Brigade Adjutant on Gen- 
eral William B. Pace's staff, was returning with 
Captain Orson P. Miles, Sergeant Heber Houtz, and 
Nathan Tanner, Jr., of the Hiles Company from 
a military drill at Manti to headquarters at Gun- 
nison, at dusk, while halting at Twelve Mile Creek 
to let their horses drink, they were fired on by 
ambushed Indians at close range; at the first shot 
Major Vance and his horse fell dead, and Sergeant 
Houtz with a groan also fell from his steed as the 
animal wheeled suddenly out of the creek. Believ- 
ing their companions both dead, Captain Miles and 
young Tanner rode rapidly back to Manti, where 
a detachment under Lieutenant M. H. Davis of Salt 
Lake County was ordered to recover the bodies of 
the dead men. 

Vance was found pierced with two bullets and 
lying where he fell within a few feet of the creek; 
Houtz had evidently recovered himself a moment 
after the first fire, for his body shot with two bul- 
lets and several arrows lay about ifive hundred 
yards from the scene of the ambush. The remains 
of the deceased were reverently conveyed to their 
respective homes, where obsequies were conducted 
over Major Vance on the 5th and Sergeant Houtz 
on the 6th of June, 1867. The services closed with 
military honors. 



268 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

THE PARAGOONAH RANGE SWEPT BY 
INDIANS. 

Indians raided Beaver and captured a herd of 
stock, June 14, 1867. The Paragoonah range was 
swept by Indians June 22, 1867. Major Silas S. 
Smith gave chase and succeeded in cutting the In- 
dians off from the mountain passes; a maneuver 
which caused the thieves to leave their booty. At 
this raid an Indian named Albert Hanks, who had 
been raised by a brother Hanks at Par o wan cap- 
tured a Spaniard who had been captured by the 
Navajoes and kept as a prisoner for several years. 
He was trying to get away from the Indians when 
captured. He afterwards made a speech at Pa- 
ragoonah, giving a detailed account of how he had 
been captured by the Indians. Among other things 
he said that they burned the bottom of his feet in 
order to cripple him, so he could not get away; he 
was kept as a servant or slave by the Navajoes, and 
he said that this was the first opportunity offered 
him to escape. 

RAID ON THE STOCK AT LITTLE 
CREEK, BEAVER COUNTY. 

At dusk on July 21, 1867, a descent was made 
upon the stock at Little Creek near Parowan, Iron 
County. The guards gave the alarm, the local caval- 
ry was quickly in motion and headed off the Indians 
at the mouth of the canyon, charging them and 
turning back the stock. The savages re-formed and 
charged twice, but were finally repulsed. The fight- 
ing lasted nearly all night.

WM. J. ALLRED RECOVERS HIS HORSES, KILLS 
TWO INDIANS. 

William Jackson Allred was the first Bishop 
of Circleville. When that town was vacated on the 
28th of June 1866. He went to Parowan, Iron Coun- 
ty, and later in the fall moved his family to Beaver. 
The next summer he worked a farm on shares at 
the Buckhorn Springs, south of Beaver, leaving his 
family at Beaver. 

One morning (Nov. 10th, 1868) when he got 
up, he sent his little boy to look for his horses and 
as the boy was gone longer than he thought he 
should, he went to look for him. The boy who had 
found the tracks of the horses, could see that they 
had been taken by Indians, and showed his father 
the tracks. Allred then took with him his five- 
shot revolver and followed the trail of the thieves 
all day, going northeast through Cottenwood can- 
yon. Having crossed Buckskin Valley into Hawkins 
Canyon, he discovered a smoke about a mile distant. 
He crawled carefully to the place where he saw the 
smoke and here the three thieves were located in a 
deep wash sitting by the fire. He stopped to reflect as 
to what was best to do and seeing one of the Indians 
with a gun laying by him Allred fired at him, and 
he fell over ; the other two jumped up and ran. He 
fired at one of them killing him, the other got away. 
When Brother Allred went down in the hollow where 
he shot the first Indian he found that the Indian 
was not dead as he raised up and shot an arrow at 
him ; it grazed his face and went up through his hat. 
Allred then shot the Indian in the head. He re- 



270 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

covered his horses, and before leaving the place he 
dragged the dead Indians together, covered them 
with brush which he set on fire, and got back in 
the night. 

SPRING CITY FIGHT, J. MEEKS AND 
A. JOHNSON KILLED. 

An account given by Marinus Lund of Spring 
City, Utah. During the month of April a com- 
pany of "Minute Men" was organized at Spring 
City, Sanpete County, Utah, for guarding, scout- 
ing and general service in protecting the settlers 
from the Indians ; the company was composed of ten 
picked men, who were on duty all the time during 
the spring and summer of 1867. Everybody moved 
along quietly until the morning of August 13th, 
1867, when about twenty men with teams left Spring 
City for the hayfield which was about six miles 
south-west of the town. Contrary to the usual cus- 
tom, the scouting ahead of the cowherd was not 
done that morning. A company of Indians, who 
evidently had spent the previous night in the stone- 
quarry hills, about a half mile south of the hay road, 
saw the cow-herd coming over the hills north of 
the road. In their effort to reach the herd the 
Indians encountered the hay teams ; the minute men 
were guarding the cow herd and were attracted by 
the reports of the guns fired by the Indians in their 
attack on the hay teams. William Scott, Sanford 
Allred and myself rode to the place where the fir- 
ing was heard. On our way we saw Andrew 
Johnson, a driver of one of the hay teams, going 
north with an arrow in his back. He had been shot 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 271 

by an Indian while on his wagon. Sanford Allred, 
who was armed with a cap and ball pistol, went to 
Spring City, to report. William Scott left me and 
rode down west. I yelled and asked him to wait 
for me. I had nearly reached him when Mr. Scott 
said "Look behind you." I then discovered that 
several Indians were riding close behind me. I 
turned in my saddle and fired at them, when they 
rode away. 

When I reached Scott, I asked him where he 
was going? He said that he was afraid his falher- 
in-law, James Meeks had been killed. I then left 
Scott and rode north to the cow herd. On the 
way I met William Blain who had been shot through 
the ear by the Indians. Mr. Blain told me not to 
get scared. I showed him the nearest way to town, 
and told him to go there as fast as he could. The 
Indum? were then ali south of us. 

I then met Jack Allred and asked him where he 
was going. He said that he was going down to get 
his horse out of the band which the Indians had 
stolen. As he was crippled I told him that I would 
go with him and help him catch his horse. I sug- 
gested that the Indians might kill him; to which he 
replied that he did not care. We went east to a 
place where other minute men were stationed on top 
of a hill. At the foot of this hill two Indians rode 
by without seeing us ; neither did we see them until 
they had passed. When we arrived at the top of the 
hill, I dismounted and tied my horse to a cedar tree ; 
as I dismounted three Indians rode by. I shot at 
them three times. Captain John Hitchcock asked 
me if I was shot. I told him "no." He then said 



272 INDIAN DBPBBDATIONS 



that my horse was shot, if I wasn't, but my horse 
was not hurt. Jack Allred said ' * You hit an Indian. ' ' 
"I am not certain whether I did or not," was my 
reply. Later we caught a mule which one of the 
Indians that I shot at had been riding. This mule 
had been stolen from Peter Oldroyd at Glenwood at 
the fight in March, 1867. I then rode towards Spring 
town and met members of the militia who were 
coming to the rescue of the herd and hay teams. The 
Indians had stolen twenty-eight head of horses and 
started to the mountains with them. We followed 
the Indians up the trail south of Bill Allred 's can- 
yon and the militia had a small engagement with 
them on the mountain-side. The Indians were fol- 
lowed to the top of Horseshoe Mountain, and on 
the way up my horse gave out. Thomas Coates, 
and a tame Indian from Moroni, and I followed to 
the top of the Horseshoe. When we arrived there 
we discovered that all the militia-men had return- 
ed to Springtown and we did not see any Indians 
there. Then we returned to Springtown where we ar- 
rived about nine o'clock at night. Here we learned 
that William Scott's father-in-law, James Meeks 
had been killed, and also that Andrew Johansen who 
had been wounded, died that night. 

RAID ON SPRING CITY 
By H. S. Ivie 

" About nine o'clock as reported on the morn- 
ing of the Spring City fight I was riding down to 
the hayfield with Sidney H. and James B. Allred, 
when about half way between the stone-quarry and 
the meadows we heard some shooting. Christian 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 273 



J. Larsen, who had a pair of gray horses (pretty 
good runners) was not far behind us. About eight 
Indians on horses came from towards Pigeon Hol- 
low towards him. Larsen who had a small boy 
with him, whirled his team around and went back 
as fast as he could go, while the Indans rode along 
beside the wagon, shooting at him and the boy. They 
shot several holes through his clothes, and also shot 
his gunstock in two, but he was not hurt. The 
main lot of Indians had been hidden in the cedars 
above the stone-quarry, south of the road. When 
we saw what was up, we turned and drove back 
till our horses got out of wind. The Allreds un- 
hitched the horses and went to where the figb 
hitched the horses and went to where the fighting 
was going on. Two men from Ephraim came along 
and one of them took me on his horse over the hill 
and let me down, when Con Rowe, who was com- 
ing out, took me into town on his horse. When we 
got to the foot of the stone-quarry hill, we saw James 
Meeks lying by the road dead; he had been shot 
through the right breast and under one eye; his 
pants and hat had been taken; his pipe lay by his 
side and his ox team was out in the brush a short dis- 
tance from the road." 

Colonel Reddick N. Allred in his journal, says : 
"I went to Ephraim to meet General Pace and 
General Robert T. Burton and to hold inspection 
only taking J. T. S. Allred. Sr. and daughter with me. 
I knew not that a band of Indians were lying in wait 
in the cedars to take the herd as soon as it was 
driven out. They made a break on the herd, killed 
James Meeks wounded Andrew Johansen and wound- 



274 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

ed Wm. Blain slightly. When we arrived at Eph- 
raim we received a telegram from Mount Pleasant 
giving the news of the raid, and we joined Captain 
Louis Larsen's Minute men who later joined men 
from Springtown and Mount Pleasant under Colonel 
Ivie. But the Indians had made good their escape 
into the mountains, taking only the horses from the 
herd. We purseud them to the top of the Horse 
shoe Mountain after exchanging a few shots with 
them. 

The "Deseret News" of August 28, 1867, pub- 
lished an account of an interview which Superin- 
tendent Head of Indian affairs, who had just re- 
turned from the Uintah Reservation where he had 
met and had a talk with the notorious chief, Black 
Hawk, who came there with his family, unattended 
by his braves. Black Hawk said he had 28 lodges 
under his sole control, and that he was assisted by 
three Elk Mountain chiefs who each had ten or 
twelve lodges with him. These Indians were scat- 
tered all along the valleys from the north of Sc-.n- 
pete county to the southern settlements, watching 
opportunities to make raids. Nevertheless he ex- 
pressed a personal desire for peace and said that 
inasmuch as the others looked to him as head chief, 
he thought he could influence them to bury the hat- 
chet and perhaps consent to a conference with Super- 
intendent Head in the near future. He declared 
he had made a covenant when he commenced to 
fight that he would not have his hair cut, and 
that he had found much fault with Tabby and 
Kanosh, who had had theirs cut like the white men. 
Now that he was w'.Un.i? to make peace, however, he 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 275 

expresses a desire that the Superintendent shear his 
locks for him, which Colonel Head very kindly did. 
Brief obituary notices were published in this 
week's issue of James Meeks and Andrew Johansen, 
who had been killed, as reported in this department 
last week, by Indians at the Springtown herd 
grounds. Mr. Meeks was 69 years of age, a native 
of England, and came from that country to Utah 
in 1853; he was one of the earliest settlers in 
Springtown. Mr. Johansen was 30 years of age, a 
native of Sweden, and had only arrived in Utah the 
previous year. 

JOHN HAY KILLED NEAR WARM CREEK 
WHILE ON GUARD. 

Communication from General Wm. B. Pace to 
Deseret News Sept. 5th, 1867. Last evening about 
11 o'clock private John Hay of Captain Binders 
company was shot dead by Indians, while tending 
the fire at the lime kiln near Warm Creek. The 
Indians crawled up within twenty feet and fired 
one gun only, then fled. It appears the guard had 
changed their position for some reason, leaving this 
avenue open. Detachments from Manti and this 
place were immediately placed upon the trials to 
interecept them without success. A reconnoitering 
party since daylight report signs of only three In- 
dians on foot, who, from the course and length of 
steps must have made twelve mile canyon in less than 
an hour from the time of committing the murder, 
Eeconnoisances are out in search of their rendezvous. 

Yours, Wm. B. Pace. 



276 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



On Sept. 4th near Warm Creek (Fayette) San- 
pete County, where three of Captain Binder's Salt 
Lake infantry were on picket duty, Indians stole 
up in the darkness, and by the light of the camp- 
fire were able to single out John Hay, upon whom 
they fired with fatal effect. His comrades gave the 
alarm to eight other men stationed near by, and 
taking the dead man with them, the detachment made 
good their retreat to the settlement. Soon after- 
wards the Indians withdrew for the winter, and the 
militia were able to devote the few remaining weeks 
of autumn to the pursuit of peace. (During this sum- 
mer and autumn a stone fort was projected and 
partly built at Gunnison for protection against the 
savages. The remains of this fort, which was never 
completed still remain as a reminder of times past.

GEN. WELLS ISSUED ORDERS FOR A 
GENERAL MUSTER. 

Sept. 17, 1867. Lieutenant-General Wells issued 
orders for a general muster of forces in the various 
military districts of the Territory, which orders 
were generally observed. At this time Adjutant- 
General Clawson was absent in the east, and the 
duties of his office were performed by Assistant 
Adjutant General Thomas W. Ellerbeck; Colonel 
John R. Winder, who had acted as General Well's 
Adjutant in Sanpete in 1866, assisted in drawing up 
a report of operations of the militia, during the 
three years campaign just described, which was pre- 
sented by General Clawson to the Governor, and by 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 277 

him to the legislature in January 1868. It is dated 
December 31st, 1867. From this document it ap- 
pears that the militia of the Territory consisted of 
one Lieutenant-General, with a staff of eighteen of- 
ficers ; thirteen topographical engineers, six officers 
of the ordnance department, two Major-Generals, 
with a staff of fourteen officers. Nine Brigadier- 
Generals, with fifty officers in the staff, twenty- 
five lieutenant-colonels with eighty five officers in 
the regimental staff, 112 majors with 113 of bat- 
talion staff, 236 captains, 228 first lieutenants. 906 
second lieutenants, 896 sergeants, 322 musicians, 
and 82 teamsters, making a total of 12,024. The 
cavalry consisted of 2,525. The artillery 179, and 
the infantry of 9,207, the remainder being the gen- 
eral officers and staff, and a topographical and 
ordnance department. The arms and equipment 
of this body were reported as several pieces of ar- 
tillery, 2,838 horses, 2,476 saddles, 4,926 revolvers, 
252 swords, 6,960 rifles, 1,719 muskets and shotguns 
25 bayonets, 431,375 rounds of ammunition, 77 trum- 
pets, 96 fifes and 107 drums. 

General Clawson in his report dated February 
9th, 1869, to the Department at Washington, terse- 
ly tells the story of these military operations and 
supplies vouchers, showing the expense of the In- 
dian War during the three years to be $1,121,037.38, 
not including charges for vast amount of service in 
the home guard, which would have mater.iyUy in- 
creased the total. The report bears Governor Dur- 
kee's official endorsements and quotes from the re- 
ports and communications of Colonels Irish and 
Heath to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. 



278 INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 



Accompanying it also was a memorial to Con- 
gress adopted by the Legislature in February 1868 
and approved by the Governor, asking for the 
payment of the expenses. The document pointed 
out that Colonel Irish had applied to General Con- 
nor for military aid in putting down the rene- 
gades, and that Colonel Head, had addressed him- 
self to the same effect to Colonel Potter and that 
in each case the request had been refused whereupon 
it became necessary to call upon the militia: that 
notwithstanding their ready response and their en- 
ergy and courage, six flourishing settlements in 
Sevier and Piute Countes, four settlements in 
Sanpete, fifteen settlements in Iron, Kane and 
Washington Counties and two or three in Wasatch 
County had been abandoned, with an almost 
total loss of stock and improvements; that about 
seventy-five lives were lost, and that in furnishing 
its own soldiers, arms, transportation, horses and 
saddles the Territory had borne a heavy burden, 
wherefore an appropriation of $1,500.000 or so 
much thereof as might be necessary to cover the 
expenses was respectfully asked. The petition was 
never granted and the just debt of the General 
Government to the then struggling Territory re- 
mains unpaid to this day. 

RAID ON BEAVER, 200 HEAD OF STOCK 
STOLEN. 

September 18th Indians raided Beaver and 
stole twc hundred head of stock. 



CHAPTER III. 

GIRL STOLEN AT WELLSVILLE, NEVER 
RECOVERED. 

On April 1st, 1868, a beautiful little daughter 
of a Mr. Thurston who lived about three miles from 
Wellsville, Cache County, was napturod by some of 
Pocatello's band of Indians, and in spite of every 
exertion she was never recovered. She was about 
three years of age, idolized by her parents, and her 
loss was to them a dreadful blow; far worse in- 
deed than her death would have been, she was never 
heard from with certainty again, except that she 
was dead. 

For detailed account of a sad story of this story 
of this stolen child the reader is referred to the 
" Contributor " Vol. 12; Page 75. 1868 Files Des- 
eret News, April 22nd, Vol. 17. 

BATTLE AT ROCKY FORD, JUSTE- 
SEN AND WILSON KILLED. 

In the spring of 1868 it was believed that In- 
dian hostilities were over and that it was safe for 
the people to return to the deserted homes on the 
Sevier. 

A company was formed under the leadership of 
Frederick Olsen of Spring City, Sanpete County. 
Their intention was to resettle Monroe. There were 
twenty-three persons in the company with twelve 



280 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

teams, namely, Frederick Olsen and son Ole, Ri.chard 
Davis, Benjamin Davis, David Davis (a boy), Axel 
Einersen, John Knighton, C. C. Brown, John Fern 
and his brother (a small boy), Walter Jones, Lars 
Alexander Justesen and his 'step son (Simon T. 
Beck), Adolph Tomson, Ira Sutton, J. W. Bohman, 
Andrew Rasmussen, Rasmus Sorensen, and Louis 
Barney. When at Cedar Eidge, (now within the 
limits of the present Vermillion), near the Rocky 
Ford, April 5, 1868, some thirty Indians, who had 
just previously attacked George and Charles Wil- 
son from Scipio, Millard County, a short distance 
north of the Rocky Ford. These men were on their 
way to Monroe after some mill irons. Charles Wil- 
son was killed by the Indians who cut the tugs 
of the harness, taking the horses and supplies. 

George Wilson escaped by running to the 
river and hiding in a hole in the bank till night, 
when he made his escape back to Scipio. 

Some of Olsen 's company had ox teams and 
traveled slow. As they came along the upper road 
the Indians came in behind them and when those 
with horse teams saw the Indians, they stopped to 
let the ox teams catch up. The savages circled out 
around into the cedars on the west of the company 
and got a little way ahead. The people seeing that 
the savages meant mischief, corralled their wagons 
as speedily as possible placing the back ends of 
the wagons in such a position that each wagon would 
shield the team on the next wagon to it from the 
fire of the Indians. 

As soon as the Indians were prepared, some 
behind cedars and rocks and others in a ravine, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 281 



they opened fire on the company. A bullet from 
an Indian's gun struck a wagon tire; it glanced 
and struck Alexander Justesen, killing him instant- 
ly. Andrew Rasmussen turned his oxen loose with 
the yoke on; they wandered away and were never 
recovered. While some of the best marksmen dii 
the shooting, others were loading guns, and sfill 
others were digging rifle pits, (holes in the ground), 
about three feet deep, and from six to twelve feet 
across. Th fight was kept up for an hour or more. 
In the meantime volunteers were asked for to go back 
to Gunnison for help; Axel Einersen and Adolph 
Tomson offered their services which were accepted. 
The Indians had pulled off and gone towards the 
ford, and were seen holding a council. When the 
expressmen started they were seen by the Indians 
who tried to head them off. Einersen rode a pretty 
good horse, and when he saw the Indians coming, he 
headed away from them towards the hills. The In- 
dians, seeing that they could not overtake him, went 
after Tomson who was following the road. They 
gained on him and fired several shots ; a bullet pass- 
ed through his thigh, cutting an artery and lodged 
in the saddle. He was also hit in the back with 
an arrow. Seeing that he could not get away from 
them, the impression came to him that if he would 
turn back and rush at the Indians, it would save 
his life. Consequently he turned, and with gun in 
hand rushed on them. The Indians opened ranks, 
seemingly surprised and let him pass, but then they 
gave chase. The men is camp seeing what was going 
on ran out, firing at the Indians, and pne of them 
fell off his horse. The Indians then turned and 



282 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



IIIIIIIIIIIIIHI 



went away, followed by the riderless horse; they 
returned in the night and carried away the fallen 
Indian. On his arrival in camp Tomson was nearly 
exhausted from the loss of blood; but the men re- 
moved the arrow and dressed the wounds as best 
they could; he was badly hurt, and it took a long 
time for him to recover. During the fight the White 
Horse Chief was constantly riding around, direct- 
ing the movements of the warriors. Walter Barney 
was hit on the shin, the bullet going through his 
pants and boot, but did not cut his under garments. 
The men kept up a guard all night. The four boys 
in the company dug a trench about three feet wide 
three feet deep and covered it with a door which they 
took out of one of the wagons and placed some rocks 
on it, and laid there two deep on top of each other. 

The next morning Einersen came with a posse 
of men to help the company back to Ghinnison. In 
the meantime the Indians had left. All went back 
with the relief sent with Einersen. No further at- 
tempt was made to resettle the Sevier country until 
1871. 

The following additional information was writ- 
ten by Joshua W. Sylvester: 

In the spring of 1868 I accompanied some Gun- 
nison boys to Marysvale to do some prospecting, 
gold having been discovered there. There were 
six of us altogether, and as we were returning home 
we camped one night in the abandoned town of 
Monroe. Next morning we resumed our journey, 
and when we got to the Rocky Ford, about twenty 
miles distant from Monroe, we saw a lone horse on 
the opposite side of the river. We also discovered 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 283 



fresh pony and cattle tracks, and upon crossing the 
river we saw a wagon, and decided to stop there 
for dinner. But when we reached the wagon we found 
that the tugs had been cut off the single-trees, and 
there were moccasin tracks around the wagon. Con- 
cluding in a hurry that we did not want dinner, we 
drove on, wondering what had happened. Upon reach 
ing the road that led to Scipio we found a board laid 
across the road upon which was written "we have 
taken the dead man from Scipio to Gunnison. ' ' As we 
drove along the west side of the river, the Gunnison 
people could see our dust for quite a long distance, 
and they imagined that they could see Indians fol- 
lowing us ; and as a squad of men had just arrived 
from Manti, and were already mounted, they pushed 
on to meet us, though the sun had gon down and 
it was getting dusk . As they were coming up one 
side of a slope we came up on the other, and when 
we reached the top and saw their dust, we thought 
of nothing but Indians, consequently we all reached 
for our guns and pistols, but right then I took com- 
mand, telling the boys not to fire a shot till I told 
them to, and if the Indians made a move to surround 
us we would let them have a shot and I would run 
the team to the river bank where we could get breast- 
works. The boys kept eyeing the squad and finally 
I said that it might not be Indians, and then they 
could see at a glance that it was not. There was a 
big excitement at Gunnison, for they knew we were 
coming. When we reached home we learned that 
a company of men who were on their way to Mon- 
roe to put in crops had been attacked by Indians ; 
they had corralled their wagons, had entrenched 



284 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

themselves and had stood off the Indians until Axel 
Einersen mounted on a smarter horse than the In- 
dians had, broke through the lines to take the news 
to Gunnison. One man was killed in the affair. 

RAID ON SCIPIO, FIFTEEN HEAD OF 
HORSES STOLEN. 

Of other Indian raids which took place in 1868, 
we may mention that on May 7th, four Indians made 
a raid on Scipio, Millard County, and drove off fif- 
teen head of horses. 

On July 5th, Seth Childs was accidently shot 
and wounded near Gunnison, Sanpete County, by 
an Indian who proved to be friendly. 

INDIANS STOP COL. IVIE IN SALT CREEK 

CANYON. 
Copied from Deseret News, July 10th. 

We met Brother Henry N. Larter of Moroni, 
Sanpete County, today, who arrived in town yester- 
day, in company with Col. John L. Ivie and the 
latter 9 s family. He reports that when they were 
about four miles below the divide above Salt Creek 
Canyon, six Utes, among whom was Tabiona, rode 
up to them and demanded to know of Col. Ivie 
whether he was "Jim Ivie," the colonel's brother. 
On being answered in the negative they passed on. 
In a short time, however, they returned, rode in front 
of the wagon, stopped it, and reiterated the question. 
One of the Indians then said that it was not "Jim 
Ivie," but his brother. At this time, Tabiona had 
his hand on his arrows, and another Indian had his 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 285 



rifle ready for use. The Indians, however, passed 
along and after going a short distance they stopped 
and held a council. The team was made to travel 
at a lively pace. When the Indians saw this two 
of them started after it, coming towards the wagon 
about three hundred yards, but seeing their com- 
panions did not follow they stopped and went back. 
One Indian was so drunk he could scarcely sit on 
his horse, and the others had been drinking, but they 
knew what they were doing. James Oscar Ivie, son 
of Colonel Ivie, one of the children in the wagon 
said, Lyman R. Peters was the driver. Mrs. Ivie 
and her children were very much frightesed; the 
mother covered the smaller children with the bedding 
in the wagon. Colonel Ivie said afterwards that if 
the Indians had overtaken them the second time, he 
intended to jump out of the wagon and let it go 
on and take his chances with them. He was well 
armed. 

INDIAN GRATITUDE. 

The following is an incident as related by Col. 
John L. Ivie, to his son James 0. Ivie : 

During the Indian troubles in the 60 's the 
Indians had stolen some cattle, and driven them up 
North Creek Canyon, between Fairview and Mount 
Pleasant. Father John L. Ivie and his company of 
minute men were in pursuit, and going up the moun- 
tain they gathered up several head of cattle which 
had been left along the trail, on account of not 
keeping up with the herd. And up among the tim- 
ber was discovered a lone Indian covered up with 
leaves ; he was sick, and not able to travel with 



286 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



the rest. Some of the boys wanted to kill him, but 
father said "no, we will not shed blood, unless it 
is necessary, " so they left him and went in pursuit 
of the Indians and stock till nearly night, when it 
was decided to give up the chase and return home, 
taking back what stock they had. 

On their return they came across the sick In- 
dian sitting up against a tree smoking a pipe. The 
men still wanted to kill him, but father wouldn't 
let them. Some time after that, Father and two 
other men were standing guard over some stock in 
the north fort of Mount Pleasant; they would fre- 
quently meet and report to each other during the 
night, and had got together at the north side of the 
fort, when they heard and saw the cattle getting 
up from their bed-ground and moving awav from 
xvhat they thought nriglit be Indians crawling among 
them. The cattle kept getting up nearer and nearer 
to where the three men stood, when father spoke 
to the others and said, "that they must be close 
by." After that they saw the cattle moving as if 
something among them was going away from them. 
When morning came nothing had been molested. 

In the beginning of the 70 's after peace had 
been restored, an Indian and his family came to 
our house and spent a day or two. He told father 
of the occurrence at the fort, explaining that he and 
four other Indians were there on that occasion and 
had their guns lying across a cow ready to shoot the 
three men, when they heard father speak and say, 
* ' They must be close by. ' ' He said he knew father's 
voice and would not let the others shoot as father

had saved his life on the mountain when he was 
sick. In appreciation he had now saved father's 
life.

SKIRMISH AT EPHRAIM, BATTLE AT 
ROCK LAKE. 

July llth, the Ephraim horse-herd was driven 
to feed about two miles southeast of town, on the 
south side of Willow Creek Wash; they were in 
care of James P. Christenseii, Sr., John Tompson 
and Sam Beal, an Indian who lived with the set- 
tlers. N. 0. Anderson and Andrew Overdale passed 
the horse-herd and went to the mouth of Willow 
Creek Canyon after wood ; they heard some shouting 
as if someone was driving cattle. They thought 
it might be men with ox-teams after wood, but it 
proved to be Indians driving animals which they 
had gathered up in the morning before the horse- 
herd came out. Anderson and Overdale began get- 
ting their loads of wood, when they heard some 
talking and thought it was a scouting party, but it 
proved to be Indians who came out into a clearing 
and approched to within thirty yards of them. The 
men being behind some trees were not seen by the 
Indians who were making for the horse-herd. The 
two men ran onto a hill south of the cedars, about a 
half mile from the herd, and saw the Indians and 
the three herds-men in battle for possession of the 
horses. The fight lasted about fifteen minutes, when 
the herders succeeded in getting most of the horses 
started for town. The Indians, however, cut out 
a few which they succeeded in getting into the hills 



288 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

and drove off. Thompson and Beal drove the 
horses, while L. P. Christensen rode in ahead and 
gave the alarm. Soon two squads of men were on 
the tracks of the Indians. One posse of about thirty 
men went by way of Willow Creek Canyon, the 
others went up Ephraim canyon which was a more 
direct route to head off the Indians. This posse 
consisted of Tory Thursten (Captain), P. C. Peter- 
sen, C. A. Larsen, Henry Oviett, Andrew 0. Ander- 
son, L. C. Larsen, Chris. Thompson (Balla), Chris. 
Nielsen, George P. Jenson, John Thompson and 
Sam. Beal, eleven in all. When they reached the 
top of a high ridge between Willow Creek and 
Manti Canyons, Indians came out and fired on them, 
Thinking they could stop them or scare them back, 
they did not check up, but continued on about two 
miles farther to a small lake on the top of the moun- 
tain known as Eock Lake. Here they were fired 
upon by the Indians from ambush at close range. 
Three horses were wounded and one fell dead un- 
der its rider (P. C. Petersen.) The horse fell on 
his leg and the dead horse served as breast-works 
and a rest to shoot from. P. C. Peterson who 
gives this information says that the battle lasted 
about an hour. The Indians were at a disadvantage, 
the brush that they were hidden in was thin and our 
men could see them and disabled some of them, which 
caused them to retreat and follow those who were 
driving off some horses and cattle. Further pur- 
suit was considered unwise owing to lack of horses 
and being but eleven in number.

COL. HEATH'S TREATY WITH INDIANS 
IN STRAWBERRY VALLEY. 

On the 19th of August, 1868 the energetic Super- 
intendent of Indian affairs, Colonel Head, succeeded 
in negotiatng a treaty with the sub-chieftains of 
Black Hawk's band and their still recalcitrant fol- 
lowers. Major Dimick B. Huntington was interpre- 
ter on the occasion, and Black Hawk himself who 
had kept his pledge given a year before, lent 
his personal influence. The young warriors were 
loth to bury the tomahawk and boasted not a little 
of their prowess and deeds of blood; one of them 
especially, a handsome, feminine-looking stripling 
named Aug-a-vor-un. After the war, Shenanagon 
confessing his participation in killing Major Vance 
and Sergeant Houtz and in other more daring and 
less dishonorable engagements. Of the fellows 
courage there could be no doubt. He had been wont 
to ride a white horse, and as his reckless bravery 
always led him to the front, where his example 
served as a command to his associates, he was fre- 
quently the mark of military sharp-shooters, and 
once when he fell wounded the cry went up that 
Black Hawk himself had been killed. His defiant 
eloquence was reinforced at this meeting by that of 
other hot-heads, but it was patiently met and at 
length entirely overcome by persuasion and threats 
of the peace party. The treaty was signed and it 
is believed was faithfully observed, although peace 
was not completely restored until after the summer 

of 1869.

NAVAJOES RAID HARRISBURG, 
SOME STOCK STOLEN. 

The earliest signs of trouble during the 
year came from the southwest where the turbulent 
Navajoes were the predominating tribe. A band 
of them invaded southern Utah in the latter part 
of February and drove off the herds from "Wash- 
ington and Harrisburg. A party of militia started 
in pursuit, recovered some of the stock and drove 
the thieves beyond the Colorado. 

FRANKLIN BENJAMIN WOOLLEY 
KILLED NEAR FORT MOHAVE. 

March 21st, Franklin B. Woolley of St. George, 
son of Bishop Edwin D. Woolley was killed near 
the Mohave Eiver, California; he had been on a 
business trip to San Bernadino, California, and was 
returning with goods for the St. George store and 
had been separated from the main body of his freight 
train and had gone to look for his horses that had 
strayed from the camp the night previous. They 
had gone back to the spring where the company 
nooned they day before, when it is supposed he was 
surrounded by a party of about fifteen Indians. He 
dismounted from his mule to parley with them, but 
finding that no compromise could turn them from 
their murderous purpose, he sought to make his es- 
cape. He fell pierced with arrows after running a 
few rods. His slayers stripped off his clothes and 
dragged his body to a place of concealment where it 
was not found until some days later by searching 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 291 



parties. The remains were brought home for inter- 
ment by the brother of the deceased, E. D. Woolley, 
Jr., now president of Kanab Stake. 

RAID ON KANE COUNTY, THREE FRIENDLY 
INDIANS KILLED. 

May 1st. Raid on Kane County, three p riendly 
Indians were killed and the marauders drove off 
eighteen head of horses. 

RAID ON KANARRA, MANY HORSES STOLEN, 
SOME RECOVERED. 
Joshua W. Sylvester. 

I will now relate the next trip we made after 
Indians : 

We had moved from Gunnison to Kanarra ; after 
living there a couple of years, on October 31st, 
1869, a very dark night, the Navajoes made a raid 
on the place, and when I got up I found my fences 
torn down and some horses gone. After breakfast 
I rode to town, about a mile distant and found the 
boys saddling the few horses they could get hold 
of, for most of their stables were empty. A man 
from Dixie had been stopping at the place and be- 
fore going to bed he had gone out to see after his 
mules in the corral. Finding the bars down he 
put them up, thinking it would be best to hobble his 
mules ; he got the iron hobbles and put on them. Next 
morning he found them shot with arrows ; that with 
the horses being gone gave the situation away; we 
knew then that Indians had been on the ground. 
We went after them, and owing to a light fall of 
snow we could consequently track them easily. We 



292 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

pushed on until dark and discovered the Indians 
making camp. They had just started a fire. We 
crawled on, and just as we were ready to fire they 
heard us, jumped up and ran, but we fired on them. 
We recovered our horses, which they had taken, and 
took their outfit. When we returned home we learn- 
ed that a raid had been made that same night all 
along the line for about forty miles. A man by the 
name of Nebeker who was camping just outside of 
Kanarra lost all his mules. Had we known they 
were gone, we could have headed them off. We 
afterwards learned that the Indians had been prowl- 
ing around for a week or two gathering horses and 
getting ready to make a general break in one night. 
They had sat on the hill watching the men put 
their horses in their stables, and where they could 
find the door in the dark they took the horses. 
They went to my stable and I suppose they could 
not find the door. I had driven four cows and an 
ox to a nice spot of grass near a spring on the 
mountain. The Indians had camped there, killed the 
animals and dried the meat. They drove stock from 
all those points but the thefts were not discovered 
until after they had gone. Had it not been that 
they got angry and shot the mules because they 
could not get the hobbles off, their success would 
have been complete. That was the way it was all 
the time. The Indians could sit on the mountain- 
side and see where our stock were and what we were 
doing and then making a dash, they would kill peo- 
ple who were at work in the fields, or traveling on 
the roads, rush their stock into the mountains, leav- 
ing some to drive them, while others fell back and 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 293 



waited in ambush on the trail for those who pur- 
sued. We hardly ever met them when they did not 
have the advantage; therefore, whenever we were 
out in the mountains, our wives, mothers and sisters 
anxiously awaited to hear from us, and they were 
actually the greatest sufferers. If they saw any- 
one riding fast into town, they all rushed to the 
meeting house to hear the news. But while they 
had women's fears they had soldiers' hearts; they 
would get provisions ready for us out of their scanty 
supplies, and often mould bullets for us, while we 
were getting other things ready ; but they never said 
"Don't go." 

NIELS HEIZELT KILLED AT 
TWELVE MILE CREEK. 

It has been stated that the Black Hawk Indian 
trouble of 1866-67 ended all organized warfare on 
the part of the aborigines in Utah. The spring of 
1872. however, witnessed some desultory depreda- 
tions by the savages, which threatened at one time 
a general outbreak. The primal cause of disaffec- 
tion among them was the treatment received at the 
hands of some dishonest government agents and 
acts of lawlessness committed by renegade white 
men. These troubles did not originate in Utah, but 
in the northern territories, whence they spread to 
this region. During the previous autumn hostilities 
in Southern Utah and Arizona had been barely 
averted by the good offices of Jacob Hamblin, the 
well known Indian interpreter, who at Fort Defiance, 
on November 2nd, 1871, concluded a treaty of peace 
on behalf of the people of this territory with the 



294 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

principal chiefs of the Navajoes. When winter was 
over the scenes of trouble was shifted farther north ; 
and while the majority of the savages were friendly 
to the settlers, a portion of them seemed bent on 
mischief. This was partly an effect of the war- 
like feeling exhibited at that time by hostile tribes 
generally throughout the country. 

Under these circumstances, Special Indian 
Agent, G. W. Dodge, early in 1872, sought to redress 
the grievances complained of by the Indians and 
distributed large quantities of flour, beef, and other 
supplies among them. The unruly ones, however, be- 
came more insolent with the efforts to pacify them, 
and levied a burdensome tax upon the settlements 
in central Utah by their persistent begging and 
stealing. On the 16th of June in a raid by a band 
of Shiberetch Indians upon Twelve Mile Creek, San- 
pete County, Niels C. Heiselt, Jr., of Pleasant Grove 
Utah County, was killed. The next two months wit- 
nessed a series of depredations in which several 
white men were shot and a large number of stock 
driven off. From friendly Indians it was learned 
that the hostiles were mostly members of unorganiz- 
ed bands such as the Capotas, Magoots and Elk 
Mountain Utes. 

During the period when the major portion of 
these outrages were committed, several hundred In- 
dians were paying friendly visits to the settle- 
ments in Sanpete, Sevier, Juab and Utah counties. 
As some of them moved about in small companies, 
there was difficulty in distinguishing -\vhich of the 
roving bands were hostile. ColoneJ Dodge endea- 
vored to simplify the situation by having all peace- 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 295 

able red men return to the reservation, but these 
could not be made to understand fully why they 
should be restrained because of the actions of hos- 
tiles not of their tribes. Therefore, though they 
consented to the measure at a council at Nephi on 
July 5th and again at Fountain Green on the 14th, 
and 16th of that month, they failed to fulfill their 
agreement, thus complicating matters. 

The aspect of affairs gradually became more 
serious. Even Indians formerly disposed to be 
friendly were implicated. 

INDIAN OUTRAGES AT MANTI, 
SANPETE COUNTY. 

Under date of August 9th, 1872, James C. 
Brown writes from Manti, Sanpete County, Utah, 
to the "Deseret News": 

The Indians are still around, and are meaner 
than ever. They have been stealing horses every 
night during the week from the range and also 
from the brethern's stables. They took one of 
mine a few weeks ago. I got him back, however, 
by paying for him. They took the other this week. 
They have tried for several nights past to steal from 
the stable of Mayor Tuttle a fine span of bays, but, 
as yet they have not been successful. They tried 
it last night and on not getting them they crossed the 
street to the stable of A. C. Van Buren and took 
one of his. A party of them went down to the range 
last evening and myself and three others who were 
on our way home from hunting horses saw them just 
about dark. We felt certain they wanted to steal 
a band of horses that was close by, we went to work 



296 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

and gathered the animals together and took them to 
town. I expect they were disappointed at losing the 
band, for they wantonly shot a mule with an arrow, 
mortally wounding it. They also went a little farther 
and shot down a steer and, with their knives cut it 
all to pieces. They manifest even a meaner spirit 
than they did before the last war. They went into 
a brothers the other day when there were no one 
at home but the latter 's wife and because she did 
not give them bread, when they asked it, they struck 
her in the face. Several instances have occurred 
when they threatened women with violence for not 
complying with their demands. The people are fair- 
ly exasperated, but do not want to take any steps 
that would tend to start an Indian war, if it can be 
avoided. I am informed that a party of Indians 
went to a stable in Ephraim a few nights ago, 
and because they could not get the horses out of 
the stable, crawled in by a small opening and cut 
the animals in a horrible manner. 

CHIEF TABBY SENDS WORD HE CAN NO 
LONGER CONTROL HIS INDIANS. 

On the 12th of August General D. H. Wells re- 
ceived the following message from Colonel E. N. All- 
red of Spring City: " Tabby sends word to all the 
Bishops, that he can control his men no longer. ' ' He 
was in Spanish Fork Canyon yesterday. I with 
a detachment brought the herd from Thistle Valley 
yesterday, having started as soon as I got word of 
the raid at Fairview. The wounded boy Stewart 
is dead." 

Next dav R. L. Johnson of Fountain Green, tele- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 297 



graphed to Indian Agent Dodge for troops to de- 
fend the people against some of the bands of sava- 
ges who had become incensed on account of obedience 
to Dodge's orders not to feed them as he would furn- 
ish them plenty on the reservations. 

COL. IVIE SENDS DISPATCH TO GEN. 
WELLS. 

Colonel John L. Ivie of Mount Pleasant sent 
the following dispatch: 

Mount Pleasant, Aug. 17, 1872, 

Gov. Geo. L. Woods, care of Daniel H. Wells 
Indian depredations here last night. Shall I 
call out the militia to defend the place for services 
generally in this county? The Indians attacked the 
telegraph operator about 11 o'clock last night in 
front of the office and, we fear, fatally wounded 
him.

Also the following was sent:

As the telegraph operator, Jeremiah D. Page, 
was leaving the office last night about 11 o'clock, 
and when near the gate by the office, an Indian 
pounced upon his back and struck him three blows, 
with a tomahawk, upon the head, inflicting severe 
wounds, one penetrating through the skull. He was 
in a critical condition all night, but seems a little 



298 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



better this morning. There were five Indians seen 
in town about the same time that the attack was 
made upon Mr. Page. Col. J. L. Ivie detailed a 
scouting party from the home guard this morning, 
and they were scouting the base of the east moun- 
tain. One scout reports no sign of Indians in 
that direction,

INFORMATION ON ASSAULT, BY 
BISHOP SEELY. 

Under date of Aug. 20, 1872, Bishop Win. Seely, 
of Mt. Pleasant writes to the Deseret News the fol- 
lowing : 

On Saturday evening suspicion rested on Rich- 
ard Smyth as being the person who assailed our 
operator on the 16th. He was arrested, but on ac- 
count of unavoidable circumstances, was held over 
until today at ten o'clock. An investigation took 
place, and when the prisoner was asked if he were 
guilty, or not guilty, he pleaded guilty of committing 
the horrible deed, after which he was committed 
to a higher court. The operator said that he was 
telegraphing a message to the operators of the 
county, and while so doing observed Smyth go into 
an adjoining room, and return and place himself 
behind him. He stood for about a half an hour, and 
as quick as the operator had finished the message 
and closed the key he was struck down and knew 
no more until he found himself lying on a lounge in 
the above named adjoining room with his head all 
mangled and his clothing all soaked in blood, and 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 299 



Richard Smyth pacing to and fro with a hatchet in 
his hand. The latter continued to walk back and 
forth along side of the lounge, making remarks about 
the deed he had done. After making a pause for some 
duration, he said, Jeremiah, hold up your hands, I 
cannot spare your life any longer, your head is all 
chopped into pieces and your brains are running out. 
I have murdered you. The operator says he resol- 
ved in his mind, weak as he was, if a chance offered 
itself, to spring upon Smyth, take the hatchet and 
kill him, but there was no chance, so he thought 
again the best way was to direct his mind upon the 
best means of liberating himself and cover up the 
deed; so from that Smyth made him swear not to 
reveal what had happened for six months, and still 
kept him there for about five hours ; without any 
assistance, soaked in his blood and perishing with 
cold. He was so weak and frightened that he dared 
not reveal anything after he got among his friends 
until Smyth had confessed he did the deed, when 
the operator made the above statement. 

Signed W. S. Seely. 

No justifiable reason for the assault on 
Page by Smyth can be ascertained, Smyth, it ap- 
pears, was subject to fits of insanity, and was prob- 
ably laboring partially under an attack of insanity, 
when he committed the assault. 

The following is added by the historian Peter 
Gottf redson : 

"The office in which Jeremiah Page was assailed 
by Richard Smyth was under the supervision of An- 
thon H. Lund. Besides the telegraph office Bro- 



300 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

ther Lund also kept a daguerrotype picture gallery 
in an adjoining room. It was quite customary for 
young people to meet and visit there. Brother 
Page was well thought of and a favorite with the 
young people, but not so much with Smyth, and it 
was the general supposition that Smyth was jealous 
of Page and that this had much to do with the act. 
I was a resident of Mount Pleasant at that time 
and well acquainted with all parties concerned. Page 
was learning telegraphy under Brother Lund and 
was night operator. " 

On the morning of August 17th, 1872, General 
Morrow left Camp Douglas with a body of troops to 
take the field against the hostiles by co-operation of 
leading men in the settlements and friendly Indians, 
the General secured a council with several chiefs, 
and after a long pow-pow held in front of the resi- 
dence of Interpreter L. S. Woods at Springville, 
made a treaty which was signed by Chiefs Tabby, 
Douglass, Joe, To-kawanah, Antero, Wandrodes, 
Parrades and Tom. Colonel Dodge, A. 0. Smoot, 
Colonel L. John Nuttall, Bishop William Bringhurst, 
General A. K. Thurber and General William B. 
Pace and other citizens were present. The treaty 
provided that the Indians should return at once 
to the Reservations. General Morrow was to apply 
to President Grant for permission for several chiefs 
to visit and lay before him their grievances, or if 
this was not agreeable, to ask that an investigation 
commission be sent out by the government. 

General Wells had an interview with Gen. Ord 
and Governor Woods in relation to Indian affairs, 
at which the former proffered all the men and sup- 



INDIAN DEPBEDATIONS 301 

plies necessary in any emergency. Gen. Ord and the 
Governor, thought, however, that there were suf- 
ficient troops available without making it neces- 
sary to call on citizens who were not in the im- 
mediate employ of the government. A body of troops 
left this morning for Sanpete and efforts were being 
made, which we presume were successful to obtain 
transportation for them from the Utah Southern 
track to the scene of their future operations. Gen- 
erale Morrow will accompany the troops in person 
and will take an active part in endeavoring to bring 
about a pacific solution of the grave difficulty, and 
thus, if possible, avert, the dreaded calamity of an 
Indian war. We understand an invitation will be 
given to friendly Indians to use their influence with 
all the red men, and an offer will be made to them 
to the effect that if they feel so disposed a deputy 
of chiefs can be organized to go to Washington, 
with the view to visiting the chief authorities of 
the nation for the purpose of laying their grievences 
before the latter, if they have any, that they may 
have the same adjusted. Gen. Ord and the Gov- 
ernor informed General Wells yesterday that they 
desired to be understood by the people that them- 
selves and their property would be amply pro- 
tected. They also stated that should it be found 
necessay to call on the people to assist the regular 
militia, Gen. Wells would be notified to that ef- 
fect. 

INDIAN CONFERENCE 

On Saturday evening Bishop Abraham 0. 
Smoot and other leading citizens of Utah County 



302 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



had a conference with the Indians at Springville 
The co-operative herd having been removed from 
Hobble Creek canyon recently, caused some uneasi- 
ness among the red men,as they construed the re- 
moval as a preparatory measure for war. Tabby 
and Douglas, two chiefs did not attend the con- 
ference, but others of their tribe were there repre- 
senting them. Tabby expressed his willingness to 
return to the Uintah reservation on condition that 
they are supplied with flour, but say some of their 
people oppose him in this. 

The Shiberetch, Capotah and Elk Mountain 
bands with a number of Navajoes were still on the 
war path. However, the troops were kept on 
scouting expeditions against them. 

TREATY CONCLUDED AT 
MOUNT PLEASANT. 

On September 17th, General Morrow, Apostle 
Orson Hyde, Bishop William Seely, Bishop Amasa 
Tucker, Bishop Frederick Olsen, Colonel Eeddick 
N. Allred and others met a number of chiefs who 
had been present at the former council. Among 
these were Tabiona, Angizebl, White Hare and some 
who were known to have encouraged, if they had not 
taken part in the depredatory incursions ; all entered 
into a treaty of peace, and it was believed that the 
principal danger of a war was passed. 

August 31st, some Indans made a raid on 
Spanish Fork stealing some horses.

ATTACK ON FAIRVIEW COW HERD, 
NATHAN STEWART KILLED. 

August 13th, Henry Larter writes from Mo- 
roni. On Saturday afternoon Bishop George W. 
Bradley, of this place sent his two sons, James and 
Jephania into the cedars with a team, to get a load 
of brush. They went to a spring about three miles 
from here to get a drink, when a number of Indians 
with guns cocked, rushed on the wagon, and cut 
the harness to pieces and made off with the horses. 
The boys made their escape to town. 

This same band of Indians crossed the hills to 
Fairview, where they were seen riding the Bishop 's 
horses, and at which place they came upon the cow 
herd and commenced shooting at the herdsmen. They 
were Peter Larsen, Morten Petersen and Nathan 
Steward. Larsen was shot through the hand with a 
gun, and also shot with an arrow in the back of 
the neck, the arrow stuck in the bone, and one spike 
in his wrist was broken off, he rode home. Steward 
was wounded,but ran home; he died on the 12th. 
Petersen was pulled off his horse; one of the In- 
dians struck him with his gun and told him to get. 
The savages took both of their horses. This hap- 
pened on the 10th of August. 

HORSES STOLEN FROM RICHFIELD. 

During the late summer, (have not been able to 
get date), I glean the following account from Eskild 
C. Peterson and others: 



304 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



During the night Indians came into Richfield 
and stole a pair of horses belonging to Andrew 
Killion. The animals were tied to his wagon in the 
southeast part of town. The Indians also took a 
band of horses belonging to Stanley Davis from 
the Prattville meadows. The trashing machine, 
horses and some others belonging to Archibald W. 
Buchanan at Glenwood were also taken. A com- 
pany of fourteen men from Richfield under Cap- 
tain Eskild C. Peterson started early next morning 
in pursuit; they went to Glenwood and awaited 
orders. In the meantime Brigham T. Young (son 
of Joseph A. Young) Stanley Davis, William H. 
Seegmiller, Cornelious Fairbanks and others were 
in consultation at Prattville and decided to 
send Brother Young to Manti to get a com- 
pany from there to go out and head off the 
Indians ; it is said he asked for two hundred men to 
go at once; but meeting with some rebuff, he tele- 
graphed to Salt Lake City without results. Peter- 
sen 's company having awaited in Glenwood till about 
three o'clock without receiving any instructions, de- 
cided that it was too late to follow the thieves; 
they went to Salina, where they remained during 
the night. There they learned of Brother Young 
going to Manti, which was the cause of the delay 
at Glenwood. Early next morning they rode up 
Salina Canyon by way of Soldier Fork; there they 
met Killion 's horses which had got away from the In- 
dians dragging a long lassoo. When they got to 
Gooseberry Creek they saw that the Indians had 
crossed it that morning, as the bank was still wet 
from them crossing. The company followed till they 
reached the summit where they could look down 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 305 



into Castle Valley. Not being prepared to camp 
out, they abandoned the chase and returned to Glen- 
wood by way of Grass Valley, crossing into Kings 
Meadow Canyon at the head of the big willow patch 
through a very rough t country and in a very dark 
night they got separated and came straggling into 
Glenwood after day-break hungry and exhausted. 

HORSES STOLEN FROM FOUNTAIN GREEN. 
(THE PURSUIT.) 

About this time on a Sunday morning P. N. 
Guyman and Wm. G. Caldwell, two boys of Foun- 
tain Green, Sanpete County, went on the range after 
some saddle horses near where the wagon road pass- 
ed through the hills toward Mount Pleasant, where 
the horses had ranged. Not finding them, they hunt- 
ed further until they found tracks and followed them 
into the hills far enough to make sure that Indians 
had taken them. The moccasin tracks showed plainly 
where an Indian had been off his horse to cinch his 
saddle. They decided to return to town and re- 
port. When they reached town, Sunday meeting was 
in process and James Guyman, father of P. N. Guy 
man, was speaking. Young Guyman interrupted 
him by saying, "Let me say a word." He then 
related what they had found; the meeting was im- 
mediately discontinued and the minute men went 
in pursuit, but the Indians had too much the start 
and was not overtaken. A company of U. S. Sol- 
diers who were in town, also went in pursuit, with 
Wm. A., ?>"yman as <--uide; they followed the In- 
dians into Strawberry Valley where they found that 
the Indians separated and had gone in different 



306 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

directions. Further pursuit would have been fruit- 
less. They found some horses which the Indians had 
ridden till they gave out; they were left along the 
trail. 

DAN MILLER KILLED AND SON 
WOUNDED NEAR SPRING CITY. 

The following sketch of the last killing of a 
white man by Indians during the Black Hawk up- 
rising, was originally prepared by Peter Gottfred- 
son, of Richfield, for the local paper, about 1882. 

The last man killed in the Indian Wars of Utah 
was Daniel Miller of Nephi, Juab County. The tra- 
gedy took place on the morning of the 26 of Septem- 
ber, 1872, at Snow and Douglas ' saw mill, in Oak 
Creek Canon, Sanpete County, three miles east of 
Spring City. The mill had shut down about a month 
before, it being considered unsafe to work there be- 
cause of Indians, but William Higbee stayed there 
as watchman. 

I had a contract to get out a bill of lumber to 
finish a new school house which was being built in 
the Second District at Mount Pleasant, and Thomas 
Gledhill, my brother-in-law, sixteen years old, was 
helping me. I was working three yoke of oxen, 
getting logs to the mill to be sawed on shares. Mil- 
ler was building a house at Nephi, and he and his 
son, (Dan M. Miller), thirteen years of age, was 
working a pair of mules getting out logs for lum- 
ber to finish his house. All told, there were five 
of us at the mill. 

The 26th of September, 1872, was Saturday. We 
were all going home except Higbee. The house in 
which we camped was about two hundred yards be- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 307 



low the mill, between the road and creek, with the 
door toward the road east. About thirtjy yards 
east of the house at the side of the road lay a pile 
of poles. The Indians had placed two small poles, 
one on each end of the pile, and a large pole on top 
of them, making an opening to put their guns through 
There were marks in the dust where five Indians 
had lain, ready to fire, if we had all gone out to- 
gether. 

That morning we maneuvered differently 
from our usual custom. I arose at day-break and 
went up to the mill to saw out a few joints that 
I wanted, which were not in the mill yard, and to 
load my wagon. I called Gledhill to go after the 
oxen which were in the hills about a mile south of 
the mill. He left the house shortly after I did. 
Soon afterwards, Miller came up to the mill and 
loaded his wagon, and in a short time Miller's boy 
came up to the mill. Gledhill brought the oxen, 
yoked them, left them in the mill yard, and re- 
turned to the house. Soon after this I went down 
to breakfast and Miller and his boy started away. 
They passed the house with their load of lumber, 
drove about one hundred yards below the house, 
around a patch of oak brush which hid them from 
view, and then stopped to tighten the binder. The 
Indians had run down behind a low ridge where their 
horses were tied to the oak brush, and from am- 
bush fired five shot, most if not all, taking effect. Mil- 
ler was shot through one arm and in the side under 
the arm, and one bullet passed through his bowels, 
breaking his back. The boy was shot through one 
thigh and through one wrist, the ball passing be- 
tween the two bones. 



308 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

We heard the shooting, but thought the Millers 
were shooting at a rabbit or wolf and took no more 
notice of it. We finished our breakfast and all three 
started up to the mill after my team. When about 
half way up, we heard the rattle of a wagon, and 
in looking back we saw a man standing up on the 
wagon driving as fast as he could make the horses 
go. Tom Gledhill said, "That fellow is driving 
pretty fast up hill." I remarked, "he must have 
had one drink too many this morning." Just then 
the man shouted, ' i There is a man shot all to pieces 
below the house. ' We then knew what the shooting 
was we had heard and started back to the house as 
fast as we could run. We saw some horsemen south 
west of the house coming at full speed through the 
brush, and thought they were Indians trying to head 
us off from the house, where we had left our guns. 
When we reached the house we saw that the men 
were from Spring City. 

The Miller boy, when shot, tried to rm to the 
house, but the Indians headed him off. They had 
not yet reloaded. The boy turned and ran down the 
road toward Spring City and met these men going 
out to look for stock. They had received word that 
Indian rigns had been seen the previous cvevini? 
in the foot hills. Some of the men took the boy 
who was very weak from the loss of bloo<] to Spring 
City and sent a telegram to Mt. Pleasant. Col John 
L. Ivie gathered up a small posse with which he 
pursued the Indians, but never overtook them. Later 
Colonel Allred took young Miller home and kept 
him until he recovered. Brother Allred 's wife at- 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 309 



tended him like a mother without compensation. 

We all went down to where Miller lay. When 
shot he had fallen off the wagon on the north 
side. The Indians, without mutilating his body, 
had dragged him about a rod from the wagon and 
laid his face on a large bed of cactus. They had 
taken his gun, pistol, food, bedding, and cooking 
utensils, and with the mules had made off in a north- 
easterly direction towards the mouth of Cedar Creek 
Canyon. It was then that R. N. Bennett, the man 
with the team drove up. He had seen the Indians 
leave, but thought they were white men. He saw 
the wagon, but did not notice that the tugs were 
cut. As he was passing the wagon he heard a man 
moan, and, turning, he saw Miller lying about a rod 
north. He stopped, tied the lines, and went to 
Miller and asked who had done this. Miller said, 
" Indians. " Bennett said, "When?" Miller an- 
swered, "Right now." Bennett asked if there was 
anybody at the mill and was answered, "Yes." He 
then lifted the old man off the cactus and drove up 
to the mill. 

When we reached the place where Miller lay, I 
put my arm under his neck to raise him up for 
some of the others to pick the cactus briers out of 
his face, and in doing so I heard his back bone grate. 
I asked if it hurt him. He answered no, but that 
he was thirsty. One of the men stepped to the wagon 
to get some kind of a vessel in which to fetch some 
water, but the Indians had taken everything of that 
kind. He, however, picked up one of the bullets that 
had been fired by the Indians on the wagon.. I said 
' ' My hat will hold water, ' ' and ran to the creek, about 



310 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



fifty yards distant, where I received a moment's 
scare. On the opposite side of the creek some wil- 
lows had been cut down and fire had been through 
them. One willow about the size of a gun barrel had 
been blackened by smoke so that it looked bright, and 
lay in such a position that it pointed right at my 
head. I thought that if I did not drop this instant, I 
would be shot. As I squatted to the ground I saw 
what it was. I obtained the water and let Miller 
drink out of my hat, after which we held consulta- 
tion and decided to make a litter of four small poles 
and a pair of Higbee's blankets, using a pair of 
overalls belonging to me for strings to lash it to- 
gether. Gledhill was sent to the house after a bucket, 
blankets and overalls. When he returned he 
was sent upon an elevation to guard against a sur- 
prise by Indians. 

The Spring City men made the litter while Hig- 
bee and I followed the trail of the Indians to learn 
if possible, where they had gone. We were armed 
with good " Henry " rifles, and followed the trail 
to the mouth of Cedar Creek canyon, about two 
miles, where the Indians had gone up a wide hol- 
low with large oak brush on both sides. I told 
Higbee that I was going there, as it gave the Indians 
too good a chance to ambush us without our get- 
ting a chance at them. He then said that he would 
go alone, and went on. I went onto a ridge where 
I could look around and could see no Indians, but 
saw one of Miller's mules feeding a short distance 
north with the harness on. I feared it might have 
been left there for a decoy to get us into a trap, but 
as the mule was feeding contentedly, I concluded 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 311 

that it had been left because it was too slow to make 
headway. I secured the mule and took it back to the 
wagon. When I reached the vehicle the men were 
ready to start with Miller. Some of the men had 
gone up to the mill and brought down my team. 

The Spring City men carried Miller, one at each 
corner of the litter, and Gledhill took Miller's 
wagon with one yoke of my oxen. I drove my wagon 
with the other two yoke. Having travelled about 
half the distance to Spring City, Miller said he 
was tired and wanted them to lay him down in the 
road to rest. We all gathered around him. I asked 
him if he would like us to take any word to his 
family if he should not live to see them. His eyes 
were turning glassy. He said he had nothing on 
his mind, but would like to see his twins before he 
died. We learned later that a pair of twin baby 
boys had recently been born to him. We asked him 
if he wanted us to take vengeance on the Indians. 
He said, "No, they don't know any better." He 
said he knew some of the Indians, one was Taby- 
any, and there were five of them. Other things 
were said that I do not call to mind. We could see 
that he was too low to proceed, and in a short time 
the poor fellow expired. Colonel Allred came up 
with a wagon, and his body was carried down to 
Spring City. That night his family, who had been 
telegraphed at Nephi, came to Spring City and took 
charge of his remains. 

Orson Hyde sent the following telegram to Salt 
Lake City, dated September 26th, 1872. 

"The Indians are upon us. Several horses were 
stolen last night. This morning a man was shot off 



312 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 



a load of lumber and his little boy wounded in the 
hip and wrist. The man is said to be Miller from 
Salt Creek." 

It was generally believed that the Indians mis- 
took Mr. Miller for Bernard Snow, as they had the 
same kind of team, a gray and a bay mule, and 
Snow often had a boy with him. The Indians did 
not like Bernard Snow. 

In one of the raids on Ephraim Bernard Snow, 
the veteran actor who was building a mill at the 
mouth of the canyon near the settlement sustained 
during several hours a lonely but heroic siege; the 
savages surrounded the mill, but the gallant de- 
fender kept up a fire so vigorous that they were 
forced to retire. (Copied from Whitney's History 
of Utah.) 

GENERAL MORROWS RECOMENDATION TO INDIAN 

AGENT DODGE. 

INDIANS GO TO WASHINGTON TO IN- 
TERVIEW PRESIDENT GRANT. 

This was the last serious raid made by the hos- 
tiles, and matters soon quieted down to their normal 
condition. The settlers had suffered more severely 
than they otherwise would have done both in loss 
of life and property because of the proclamation of 
Governor Shafer, and Acting Governor Black, pro- 
hibiting the assembling of the militia. Governor 
Woods refused to rescind that order when applied 
to in July of the same year, even to enable the peo- 
ple to defend themselves. Of the action of tjie 
citizens in obeying the edict of the Executive, Gen- 
eral Morrow said in his report to Indian agent, 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 313 

IHIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMMIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll 

Dodge: "I think I may say with truthfullness that 
there is not another American community in the 
nation which would have endured half the outrages 
these people have endured without rising up as one 
man to drive out the savage invaders at the point 
of the bayonet. On any principle of self defense 
they would have been justified in doing this. In 
the same letter the General made the following re- 
commendation : l ' Now, sir, I have given you a plain 
statement of facts, and I desire to invite your at- 
tention, and through you the attention of the Indian 
Department, in the justice and propriety of making 
this people some recompense for their losses. This 
may be done, I believe, from the appropriation made 
by Congress for these tribes. It is only an act 
of simple justice to the poor people who have suf- 
fered so severely that it should be done. It is some 
time since I had occasion to examine the subject, but 
I believe there is a law of Congress, I think of 1834, 
which authorizes compensation to be made in cases 
like the present, and prescribes the manner in which 
it shall be done. If this course is pursued now, 
it will not only be proper in itself as an act of 
justice to the people, but it will also teach the 
Indians that they cannot commit depredations with 
impunity. ' ' 

To General Morrow's letter, Colonel Dodge re- 
plied: "I fully concur with you in all the statements 
you have herein made," adding, "Your reference 
to the great losses on the part of the citizens of the 
disturbed district is eminently just, and I shall do 
everything in my power to bring such relief to the 
sufferers as the law will allow." He also supported 



314 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

General Morrow's, application in behalf of the In- 
dians, asking permission for a delegation of chiefs 
to visit President Grant. This application was 
favorably acted upon, and on October 17th, Chief 
Wandrodes, Antero, Tabiona, and Kanosh accom- 
panied by Judge George W. Bean of Provo as in- 
terpreter, left Salt Lake City with Special Agent 
Dodge to confer with the " Great Father" at Wash- 
ington. Since then depredatory acts by Indians in 
Utah have been rare.

THE TRADITIONS OF THE UTAH INDIANS IN RE- 
LATION TO THE CREATION OF THE WORLD. 

When the gods made the world it was dark 
all over the face of the earth; and they said let 
us have light; and the chief said, I will make it; 
I have no arrow long enough to penetrate through 
the darkness. So he groped about and found some 
willows (Cannab), and broke the longest one he could 
find, put it upon his bow and shot upwards. In a 
short time a small star appeared. They watched 
it and it soon began to grow ; light came in, the ori- 
fice expanded, the darkness disappeared, and they 
could see to divide the water from the land ; and they 
made dry ground, and the rivers, lakes, springs, and 
small streams, and they all sang together. 

THE FLOOD. 

The people of the earth a long time ago be- 
came exceedingly wicked, and the Lord sent out a 
proclamation for all of the inhabitants of the whole 



316 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

earth to come together, for he wanted to talk to 
them. They met in a large valley and the Lord came 
down and stood, one foot on one mountain and the 
other foot upon another mountain; but the people 
would not listen to Him. He then called all of his 
friends to come to Him. They came two of every 
kind of beasts, and a few men, women and children, 
and they made a covenant to hearken unto Him. 
The others kept talking and would not hear Him, 
Then the Lord was angry; he stooped down and 
pulled up a large tree and whipped every living 
thing to death except his friends, and then He told 
them to go and throw or scatter their young upon 
all the face of the land and be His friends. 

ELIJAH FED BY RAVENS. 

A great many moons ago a woman strayed off 
and got lost from her lodge. She became very hun- 
gry, and cried to the Lord for food, and He sent 
ravens to carry her food for many days. After a 
while she found her lodge, and there was great re- 
joicing among here people when she told them what 
the ravens had done. 

THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST. 

A great many years ago the Lord (Towats) 
lived in the Piede country. His house is standing at 
this time. He had a son who died and when he 
died the earth was broken up; there were earth- 
quakes and terrible thunderings and lightnings. It 
was very dark for three days and nights. It was 
so dark the people could feel the darkness with 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 317 



liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiii inn in 1111 iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiu ii 



their fingers ; and all of this time they were howling 
and crying, for they could not make fire burn. They 
had to eat all their meat raw. The third day His son 
came to Hfe and the darkness disappeared, and there 
was great rejoicing. The Lord had a brother, but- 
they were not on friendly terms with each other. 
And he, the brother, had a son who died, and his 
father went to the Lord (his brother) to ask him why 
it was not dark. The Lord told him it was because 
he opposed him in all things. The Lord's brother's 
name was Shinnob. The Lord told him to go home, 
cut off his hair, burn up his lodge, kill his horses, 
howl, and lacerate his flesh, for the third day his 
son w^ould stink; and it was so. Hence comes the 
tradition, which is ; That when they die their spirits 
go to a large canon in the Sierra Nevada mountains 
where there is plenty of game, and they hate to 
have their relatives die and go poor to the hunting 
grounds. This is the reason why they kill the dead 
man's horses to go with him for him to ride. It is 
customary with them to kill a prisoner or some 
poor person to go with them to wait on them. 

WAH-KER'S HISTORY. 

Wah-ker was born about the year 1815, on the 
Spanish Fork River, Utah County, Utah Territory, 
and was one of the shrewdest of men. He was a 
natural man ; read from natures books. He was very 
fond of liquor; but when in liquor you could not 
get him to make a trade. 

Wah-ker means "yellow," or "brass." When 
about twenty five years of age he had a curious vi- 
sion. He died and his spirit went to heaven. He 



318 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

saw the Lord sitting upon a throne dressed in white. 
The Lord told him he could not stay; he had to 
return. He desired to stay, but the Lord told him 
that he must return to earth; that there would 
come to him a race of white people that would be 
his friends, and he must treat them kindly. The 
Lord gave him a new name. It was Pan-a-karry 
Quin-ker (Iron twister) in 1846 or '47 he went to 
California with a lot of Piede prisoners. He frighten- 
ed the Piedes into giving him their children, which he 
took to lower California to trade for horses to enrich 
himself, taking many of his tribe with him. The Span- 
iards gave him numbers of beef cattle and charged 
him for them, where upon he started for home. When 
out two days he called a halt, held a council, and sent 
the old men, women and children on towards home. 
The third day ten men returned to visit the Span- 
iards. Each man visited different ranches, and took 
a large number of horses. The Spaniards raised a 
large force and pursued them, and recoverd many, 
but lost six or seven hundred head of wild horses, 
for which the Mexicans offered a large reward. The 
Indians pushed the horses so hard that they lost 
several on the desert. 

He remained king of the mountains until about 
1852, when he inaugurated what is called the Wah- 
ker war, through which many whites lost their lives ; 
and which cost Utah Territory over a million dol- 
lars. 

Soon after he was taken sick near Fillmore, 
in Millard County, and was ill but a short time when 
he was stricken with death, being blind for three 
days. He would have the men raise him up, when 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 319 

he would talk to them, telling them not to fight the 
whites as he had done. When he died there was a 
terrible howling. The men jumped upon their horses 
and killed seven head of horses, one Piede woman 
(a prisoner), and one boy, and carried Wah-ker up 
into the mountains, put his body into a cliff of 
rocks, walled it up and put a Piede boy in with 
him alive. Three days after, as some Indians were 
riding by, the boy called out to them and asked to 
be let out. He said Wah-ker began to stink and he 
was hungry. They laughed at him and rode on. 

Wah-ker had three brothers: Ara-pene, Sam- 
pitch, and Tabby. Tabby is at present the head chief 
of the ITtahs proper, and is on the Uintah reser- 
vation. (1872.) 

Ara-pene was a great orator, but a hard- 
hearted man. At one time in Manti he got mad 
at his wife and burned her in a fearful manner with 
a frying-pan handle that was broken off the pan. 
She crawled to the settlement and the white women 
nursed her until she recovered. 

At another time he came down out of the moun- 
tains with some deer-skins and a Piede prisoner, a 
small boy, to trade. The price was too high for the 
child, whereupon, in rage, he took the child by his 
heels and dashed his brains out by thrashing the 
ground with his head. 

In 1849, when fifty of us were exploring the 
' ' Dixie ' ' country, in the month of December, we met 
Ara-pene on his way from the mountains on the Se- 
vier river, coming down to winter. An old squaw 
had a long roll of cedar bark, one end of which was 
on fire so as to light a fire quickly. We all camped 



320 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

together. Ara-pene had one daughter, about nine 
years old, and she was very sick with measles. She 
died that night ; and the Indians held a council whe- 
ther to kill one of us or a Piede prisoner, a boy 
about six years old, to send with the daughter. In 
the morning two young men came out of Ara-pene 's 
lodge, loading their rifles and driving the Piede be- 
fore them. I shall never forget how pitiful he looked, 
for he knew what his fate was. He asked to take 
off his moccasins and was refused. It was very cold. 
They drove him about four rods from camp, when 
both fired and the poor little fellow rolled down 
from off the little knoll on which he stood. He was 
buried along with the girl. 

THE UTES. 

Have no marriage ceremony. They buy and 
sell their women and daughters. They have many 
wives and the women do the hard work, dressing 
all their skins. When the hunters return from a 
hunt, if he brings in any game the women unload it 
and unsaddle the horses. The hunter does nothing 
more until the meat is gone, when the women bring 
up the horse, saddle him, and he goes on the hunt. 
The men are intensely fond of gambling, horse-rac- 
ing and shooting at the target. The women love 
to gamble with sticks for beads and paints, etc; 
and are also fond of playing ball in summer time. 
They are very affectionate to their children. 

The Utes have no religious ceremonies, but are 
great for doctoring. A "medicine-man" is looked 
upon as one that can handle the thunder balls and 
stand in the fire with his bare feet. Their medicine

UTE AND PIUTE TRADITIONS. 
By H. J. Gottfredson. 

The Ute and Piute Indians have traditions very 
similar. Hans J. Gottfredson was in business at 
Eldorado Canyon on the Colorado River for about 
seven years, and employed Piute Indians ix work 
for i im. He camped out with them a considerable 
and from them learned some of their traditions with 
regard to the creation, and the Lord's dealings with 
his children. They believe when the earth was 
created that it was level and beautiful, that fruit 
and vegetation grew spontaneously, that game was 
plentiful everywhere and that all was peace, that God 
(Towats) lived in the south, and that the Lord had 
two sons. The elder son, who was independent and 
could always take care of himself, was the father of 
the Indians who inherit his nature: the younger 
was a cry baby always wanting everything he saw, 
and he is the father of the white people. The Lord 
granted him his desires, and the whites inherit his 
disposition, that is the reason why the white people 
are smarter in getting and in inventing and mak- 
ing things. But as orators they are not the equals 
of the Indians. 

At one time the father became vexed at his 
children for some cause or other and tearing through 



322 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

the country from south to north he tore up the land 
as he went along, leaving it in the present condi- 
tion, with mountains, hills and deserts and not fer- 
tile as it was. But that he will sometime come back 
and level the land and make it as it was before. Then 
it will be the happy hunting ground. The Indians 
are superstitious and believe there is some kind of 
charm about writing and making pictures. They 
also believe in Satan (Shin-nob) who is always bent 
on doing harm, that he delights in seeing people do 
wrong. They do not serve God, because he is good 
and will not harm any-thing; but they serve Satan 
through fear; they want to keep peace with him. 
Many of them, when they eat, throw the first bite 
over their left shoulders, and when asked what that 
is for, they say that is to feed Satan to keep peace 
with him. They believe that the white people can 
write to him and he will cause sickness or trouble to 
come onto others. And should you write the name 
of an Indian on a slip of paper and tell him that you 
was going to send it to Lucifer, the Indian would 
risk his life, if necessary to get possession of it. 
When trouble comes to them, they think, that if they 
do something to please him, it will stop the trouble. 

The writer had some acquaintance with the In- 
dians in the early sixties, they were hospitable if 
a person came to their camp hungry, and they ex- 
pected the same from the whites. If they were 
trusted with anything, they could as a rule be de- 
pended upon, and were generally truthful ; they dis- 
pised a falsifier. There were many small bands of 
Indians in the country at that time, and we could 
run onto an Indian camp in many places. In the 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 323 

summer of 1864 I was herding cattle and sheep in 
Thistle Valley. Once I followed some cattle tracks 
into the west mountains traveling over hills and 
canyons for about fifteen miles to Mount. Nebo. 
As it was late in the day, night soon overtook me. 
I had with me my Kentucky rifle and a dog. The 
night was dark and as I could not remember how 
many canyons I had crossed I went down the 
wrong canyon. Near midnight I was attacked by 
a lot of dogs and I knew they were Indian dogs. 
They were fierce and had it not been for my dog, 
it is hard telling what the result would have been. 
I yelled when some Indians got out of their blankets 
and came up and called off the dogs. I went down 
with them to their camp. They knew me and said 
that I was the sheep captain. Some young squaws 
came out and stirred up a fire and roasted deer 
meat for me. They offered me some of their bread 
which was made of berries and large wingless black 
crickets the size of the end of my thumb, they call it 
Queash. I showed them the cricket legs and said they 
were ' ' Kay-wi-no. " not good. They laughed at me. 
The Indians offered me blankets to sleep in but as 
I told them that my folks would be worried about me 
and would be out at daylight hunting for me. An In 
dian went down the canyon with me about a mile 
to where a trail led into Thistle Valley, and I got 
to camp about daylight. 

The Indians realized that they were being 
crowded off their hunting grounds and would often 
tell us so; they wanted cattle, horses or sheep in 
payment for it They never stayed long on a camp- 
ground, but moved to new hunting grounds and pas- 



324 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

tures where feed could be found for their horses. In 
the morning before breaking camp, the Chief would 
call the Indians around him and talk to them for half 
an hour or so, instructing them as to their move- 
ments. Then each would go to their several tasks 
some would go hunting on the way to the new camp 
ground. The squaws did the packing and moving of 
camp while the men and boys gathered up the horses 
and did the easy work. 

They loved hunting, and as scouts and trailers 
they were far superior to white men. If a twig had 
been newly broken, or a stone moved they always 
noticed it and learned the cause. They were so 
thoroughly acquainted with the mountain trails, can- 
yons and watering places, and knew the hiding 
places in case of danger or pursuit so well, that they 
were hard to locate. They would often travel long 
distances without leaving any tracks or signs, by 
walking on rocks, or wading in streams, and thus 
conceal their movements. They generally made 
small fires and hovered closely over them, burn- 
ing mostly sage brush, which made the best embers 
and coals and kept the fire better, when covered, 
than other wood. They thought white men foolish 
for making large fires and have to sit back. The 
Indians always smelled smoky because of sitting over 
their small fires so much, and being in their wicki- 
ups. 

AN EXPLORING TRIP AND TREATIES WITH IN- 
DIANS IN GRASS VALLLEY AND VICINITY, 
BY A. K. THURBER, G. W. BEAN AND 
OTHERS. 

On or about the 1st of June, 1873, President 
Brigham Young and Council called Bishop Albert 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 325 

K. Thurber and Wm. Jex of Spanish Fork, George 
W. Bean, Bishop Abraham Halladay, General Wm. 
B. Pace and George Evans, of Provo and some others 
to take a party and explore the country southeast 
of Sevier Valley and make treaties of peace with 
the Indians in that vicinity. Consequently, on the 
4th of June, 1873, a party of ten men left Provo, 
Pleasant Grove and American Fork. At Spanish 
Fork four other men joined and at Warm Creek 
(Fayette) one at Nephi, and at Salina one more man 
joined. From Richfield, Glenwood and Prattville 
came five more men. The noted Chief Tabiona ac- 
companied them as guide. The party fitted out 
with saddle and pack horses, and started out on 
Indian trals southeast over the mountains. George 
W. Bean had previously acted as Indian interpre- 
ter for President Young, and also for the govern- 
ment. Bishop Thurber could also speak the Ute 
language and Chief Tabiona accompanied them both 
as guide and as mediator between the Indians and 
Whites. Interpreter Bean had obtained from the 
government two pack-horse loads of blankets, shawls, 
beads, butcher knives, calicos and numerous other 
articles, such as the Indians like, to give to them in 
order to obtain their good will, and keep peace 
with them. 

We left Prattville June llth, 1873 and camped 
at Brimhall Springs. Next morning we traveled up 
a nice narrow valley through grass which in places 
touching our stirrups, and at the head of the valley 
we found a large grizzly bear that had just been 
killed and skinned; it looked as large as a cow, 
so they named the place Bear Valley, and it still 



326 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



retains the name. About half a mile farther on was 
a bunch of quaking-asp, the largest about seven 
or eight inches in diameter. We noticed that one 
of the trees had the bark pealed off half way around 
up about seven feet from the ground. We learned 
later that the bear had an Indian up that tree for 
about twenty-four hours, and he was in such a hurry 
getting up that he dropped his gun, but later killed 
the bear. 

On the night of the 12th we camped on the 
spot where Burrville is now located. Here we no- 
ticed the prettiest natural meadows that I ever saw, 
and there was bunch-grass all over the hills. Hence 
we named the place Grass Valley. Next day, the 
13th, we reached Fish Lake about 3 o'clock p. m. 
There we saw our first Indian; he was after fish; 
but as soon as he saw us, he jumped onto his 
pony and rode up the creek through the quaking- 
asp timber as if he expected to be shot at every 
minute. Tabiona called for him to stop, but he kept 
going. Some of the members of our company be- 
came a little uneasy, knowing that the band was 
camped not far away. I unsaddled righf quick and 
ran over to where the Indian had been fishing, and 
there was about forty fish lying on the D#.nk of 
the creek and thousands more in the little c^eek 
(Doctor Creek.) I ran down the little stream three 
or four rods and started to throw out fish. By the 
time the others had un-saddled and unpacked they 
came and stopped me. I think I had about 300 
fish and I was down on my knees throwing them 
out with both hands. They threw back those that 
were still alive but we took 210 to camp. It will 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

be well to state that the fish in this locality go up 
the small streams to spawn in such numbers that 
they can hardly move. We cleaned and salted what 
we had taken, and got the Indians to dry and smoke 
them and bring them to Cedar Grove in Grass Val- 
ley twelve days later two seamless sacks full. We 
prepared supper early, and after picketing and hob- 
bling our horses (keeping them between our camp 
and the lake) we made our beds scattered in the 
brush. It was agreed that all were to keep quiet 
and lie low. Tabiona, my father or A. K. Thurber 
being the only ones allowed to talk. Not long after 
dark, our horses began to snort and make an awful 
fuss, trying to get loose. Tabiona called out and be- 
gan talking; then also my father and Thurber. Ta- 
biona spoke again, and finally two old squaws an- 
swered him and came into camp. We gave them 
presents and sent them back to their camp; they 
soon returned with about half the tribe. Old Poga- 
neab (Fish captain) their chief, tried to keep them 
from coming and was on the fight. A little later 
most of his fighting men came in and said it was 
safe to build fires, and about midnight the chief 
and his two squaws, and eight or ten more, came 
into camp. 

We talked to them, and gave them presents till 
about two o'clock in the night. We then sent them 
to their camp, but told them to come back in the 
morning. 

We had a big talk all day. At the meeting 
Tabiona spoke and said that when at Washington 
visiting the Great White Chief (President TJ. S. 
Grant) he saw three persons of fine appearance, 



328 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

dressed in white robes and they had long white 
flowing beards; the friends to the Indians, the 
white men did not see them, but he did Some 
also thought that they might be the three Nephites 
spoken of in the Book of Mormon. Old Poga-neab 
became very friendly, and accompanied us on foot 
all the way round till we met the tribe at the council 
previously arranged at Cedar Grove. One of his SOPS 
went with us. We left Fish Lake June 151 h and 
went to the place where Thurber is now located. .A. 
K. Thurber liked the creek and location so well that 
we named the place Thurber in his honor. Next 
day we went to the lower end of Rabbit Valley, and 
during the day we caught a lone wild horse, and 
an antelope. Twenty seven of us circled round 
them and closed in on them. "Where ever we went 
the deer were nearly as plentiful as the fish in the 
lake, and were quite gentle but we never killed 
more than we wanted to eat. 

We camped in a nice grove of long-leaf pines 
which grew right down to the valley, and called the 
place Pine Creek ; it is known as Pine Creek to this 
day. Here we picketed about half of our horses, 
hobbled the rest and built some nice big fires. All 
of a sudden several of our horses snorted and 
stampeded, running up the creek. Our ropes held 
fifteen animals I think. The night was dark, and 
as we had not been up the creek we let them go 
till morning. We knew there was another camp 
or tribe of Indians down there, somewhere, but not 
having seen any signs of them, we did not expect 
to see them till next day. Some of their scouts 
or guards, however, were out. 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 329 

We put our fires out and all laid flat on the 
ground. It made old Poga-neab so mad, Tabiona 
said, that he swore at them He and his son went 
out on the trail and were gone about an hour, talk- 
ing loud, telling the Indians to come in the morning. 

We all rested next day and found our horses 
two or three miles up the creek. When the Indians 
came in, we gave them presents and made peace with 
them. Their squaws brought us forty nice trout 
that they had caught in their willow traps. The 
name of their chief was Angewetimpi. We noticed 
quite a difference in the Indians of the two tribes, 
though they lived only forty to sixty miles apart. 
Next day we started up Pine Creek through timber 
and grass and saw lots of deer which were quite 
tame. About sun-down we crossed a divide and 
came into a nice little flat where the water ran 
down into Grass Valley, as we learned later. We 
were just going to camp for the night, when we saw 
an old coyote with three young ones. We gave chase 
and caught the little ones, cut their ears and tails off 
short, tied a paper collar around one's neck and 
turned them loose. We named that stream Coyote 
It still retains that name and there is a settlement 
there now by that name. Next day we went south 
on to the Boulder Mountain, passing through big long 
leaf pine timber. We also saw springs and meadows 
and ]ots of deer, chickens, etc. In two dp.ys we 
reached the head of the east fork of E sealant o creek, 
now called Potato Valley. Here we found a small 
band of Indians and after making peace with them, 
we came down the river and went up Grass Valley to 
the Cedar grove, just below the present site of Burr- 



330 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



ville, where we met the Fish Lake tribe of Indians. 

We stopped there a day in council with the In- 
dians ; the next day we went back to Prattville, and 
then returned to our homes. 

When the result of this trip was reported to 
President Brigham Young the result was that Bish- 
hop Albert K. Thurber and George W. Bean were 
immediately called to settle in Grass Valley and as- 
sist the Indians who would gather there to culti- 
vate the arts of peace and industry. 

At the time of the meeting July 1st, 1873, 
a heavy snow storm came up which was a reminder 
that we were in the near vicinty of the top of the 
rim of the Basin, five or six miles distant. The In- 
dian talk was highly satisfactory to all parties, and 
the promise made by the natives has been exceed- 
ingly well kept ever since. 

In the spring of 1874, (about April 12th), these 
men with some of their sons and some others in- 
cluding the noted Porter Rockwell commenced 
operations in Grass Valley. Among the others 
who came into the valley were Tom and Billy Mc- 
Carthy, James H. Clinger, Aaron and Dave Dan- 
iels from Provo, a man by name of Prator who had 
a family and a few others who took up ranches. We 
put up a lot of hay that summer. 

THREE NAVAJO INDIANS KILLED IN GRASS 
VALLEY. 

That fall four Navajoe Indians came into the 
valley to trade blankets for horses with the Grass 
Valley Indians. While in Grass Valley, It was re- 
ported, they had killed a calf belonging to the Me- 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 331 



Carthys and trouble arose. Just as they were leaving 
they called at McCarty's cabin sullen and saucy. The 
ooys who were getting breakfast motioned for the 
Indians to go. The boys guns were all in one cor- 
ner of the cabin, and the Indians who got between 
them and their guns, now motioned for the Ooys 
to go. The boys went out to the ?orral ani stable 
to plan what was best to do and in the meantime 
the Indians ate the boys breakfast. Mr. Clinger 
had come to the cabin riding a fine horse, which 
he tied to the fence just before the Indians came. 
Though the Indians were in possession of the boys 
guns there was no ammunition the boys carried that 
in their belts and pockets. The boys finally tied up 
a large bundle of hay in their lasso's and started to 
roll it toward the house. The Indians got scared and 
made a run, two of them getting on Clinger 's horse, 
and the other two taking their best horses. The 
boys got their guns and started to shoot, killing the 
two on the Indian ponies not far off. The others 
on Clinger 's horse got away. The boys saddled up 
fresh horses and followed the Indians down the val- 
ley. After getting quite close they killed one In- 
dian and wounded the other as well as the horse. 
The wounded Indian left the horse and went up a 
rough canyon, as it was getting dark the boys re- 
turned to their cabin. 

The wounded Indian was twenty-one days get- 
tng home, eating anything he could catch, on the 
way, as he had no matches to make a fire. As 
word soon came that the Navajoes were coming to 
kill the whites. All the whites left Grass Valley, 
except Praitor and Family, Aaron Daniels, G. T. 



332 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

Bean and E. P. Bean. We had to stay to feed the 
stock. The Utes who were friendly said they would 
take care of us. We wintered in the valley all 
right till we run out of salt. We were snowed in 
and it took three days on horse back to get to 
Glenwood. 

UTAH INDIAN WAR VETERANS ORGANISE 
AT SPRINGVILLE. 

In the afternoon of July 4, 1893, a few of the 
veterans of the Black Hawk War, met upon the 
public square at Springville and talked over the 
old troubulous war times and it was there agreed to 
have a re-union of the Black Hawk warriors, their 
families* and friends, sometime during the ensuing 
winter. The prime movers in the affair were George 
Harrison, Edwin Lee, Joseph M. Westwood, Albert 
Harmer, Francis Beardall and Walter Wheeler. 
Another meeting was held January 1, 1894, at which 
in addition to the above named, there were present 
Thomas A. Brown, Eliel S. Curtis and Samuel Bulk- 
ley, and it was there arranged to invite all the com- 
rades of the Black Hawk war residing in the county 
to meet at the Reynold's hall, January 24th, 1904, 
for a grand ball and picnic. A local society was 
organized about the same time called the "Spring- 
ville Comrades of the Black Hawk War." The 
first captain was J. M. Westwood and Thomas A. 
Brown was Adjutant and Quartermaster. From the 
local Springville organization evolved the state or- 
ganization, known as the "Utah Indian War Veter- 
ans Association " under whose auspices the great 
encampment was held in (1900). Joseph M. West- 



INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 333 

wood was made commander-in-chief , and Thomas A. 
Brown, adjutant and quartermaster of this organiza- 
tion. During the previous year the ' ' Home Guards ' 
and "Walker and Tintic War Veterans" held re- 
ceptions, balls and feasts, w r hich were patronized and 
looked forward to as events to be prized for their 
social and enlivening characters. 

On the 25th day of January, 1894, the Black 
Hawk War Veterans held their first re-union, at the 
Reynolds Hall at Springville, commencing at two 
o 'clock, p. m. and continued, with an interval for sup- 
per until 4 o 'clock a. m. next day. 

There were one hundred and eleven veterans 
present from various parts of the county. 
On the arrival of the visiting delegations at Spring- 
ville they were met with sleighs, under the direction 
of George Harrison, and taken to the homes of the 
Springville comrades, where old acquaintances were 
revived and stories of the war times recounted. At 
2 o'clock p. m. order was called by Captain F. P. 
Whitmore and the Springville comrades opened with 
a song, entitled "The Black Hawk War." F. C. 
Boyer made an .eloquent speech of welcome. At 6 
o'clock, p. m., the supper hour arrived. A tent was 
pitched outside and a fire kept burning, to remind 
all of the early camping days. At intervals be- 
tweor dances, speeches were made by Orson Croer, 
of Spanish Fork, an original poem was recited by 
Milando Pratt, and Albert Jones sang an old-time- 
song, composed during the Sanpete campaign of 
1866-67. Levi N. Kendall, a Utah Pioneer, made re- 
marks and Colonel Page of Payson, recounted some 
incidents of the war. Benjamin Driggs told about 



334 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

campaigning in Sanpete; D. C. Johnson told of the 
fight upon the Diamond and the gallant ride of 
Noakes, Curtis and Stewart; John Tanner of Pay- 
son told now he got out of a certain scrape at Nephi ; 
B. W. Brown narrated his experiences at the fight at 
Gravelly Ford, in Sevier County, etc. Thus with 
music and song the first happy reunion of the In- 
dian fighters of Utah passed into history. Since then 
the reunions have been held annually, also a mid- 
winter dance and festival. 

All the counties which furnished assistance dur- 
ing the war have been organized into departments 
of the organization, and most all the towns and cities 
have had their local posts. 

Local and State camp-fires and reunions have 
been held, which have kept the fire of fraternal 
friendship burning. 

Through the efforts of Commander J. M. West- 
wood the organizations have been kept alive. I do 
not know of another man, who would have continued 
for twenty-five years or more to keep in touch with 
the organization and lead it as long as he has done, 
and I verily believe that if this organization had 
not existed the Black Hawk Indian War Veterans 
services would not have been recognized by the Fe- 
deral Government, nor pensions granted. I feel 
that we, as Indian War Veterans, owe him our sin- 
cere gratitude as well as those who have stood by 
him, of whom I will mention George Harrison and 
Moroni L. Pratt. 

We have held three State encampments, namely : 
first at Ephraim, Sanpete County, the second at 
Heber City, Wasatch County, August 12th to ItftU, 
1911, the 3rd at Springville, Utah County, August

20th to 23rd, 1912, and twenty-four annual camp- 
fires have been held in Utah County. 

Camp-fires have also been held in other coun- 
ties in the State where sufficient veterans reside. 
This year, A. D., 1918, the State Organization is com- 
posed of: Joseph M. Westwood of Springville, Utah 
County, Commander-in-Chief ; Rudolphus N. Bennett 
of Mount Pleasant, Sanpete County, First Vice- 
Commander; Joel Andrew Johnson of Provo, Utah 
County, Second Vice- Commander and Peter C. Peter-

REUNION AT MANTI, JOHN LOWRY STATES 
CAUSE OF BLACK HAWK WAR. 

The occasion of the present re-union being op- 
portune, in order to correct an erroneous impression 
that has become wide-spread as to what precipated 
the Black-Hawk War. I take this opportunity or 
means of placing the facts before the world. 

But first let me state that I came here as a 
pioneer, and took part in the first battle fought with 



336 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 

she Indians under command of Col. John Scott. And 
I have in one way or another been associated with 
almost every Indian trouble in the early history of 
this region. I served as Indian interpreter for years 
in Manti, and have passed through many close places 
in dealing with the red men. At times having been 
surrounded by them when I knew that one word, 
look, or action would have cost me my life in the 
event that I showed fear. A man who betrayed cow- 
ardice might be killed without any consideration, 
but a brave man was always approached with con- 
sideration. Among them were some strange tradi- 
tions and peculiar notions in relation to their spirit- 
ual life, they served Satan, not God, the idea being 
to placate the power bent on doing injury. The el- 
der Brother (God) was good, and never harmed any- 
one, but Satan was served through fear. For in- 
stance, should a white man write the name of an 
Indian on a slip of paper and give it out that it would 
be sent to Satan, the Indian would sacrifice his life 
if necessary to get possession of it. In 1864 a 
small band of Indians were wintering at Gunnison, 
many of them died, and they found reason for their 
trouble in conclusion that the Mormons had written 
their names and sent them to Satan. And he had 
caused death to come upon them. So in their coun- 
cils they were directed by their Chief to stop the 
sickness among them by killing (Mormons) in re- 
taliation. In February Black Hawk informed me 
what the Indians were going to do when the snow 
went off." They would kill the Mormons and eat 
Mormon beef. I immediately went to my Bishop 
with the information. He thought, as did many 
others, that it was just Indian talk and amounted to 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 337 

nothing ; but the Indians told me several times what 
they intended to do, and so I went the second time 
to the Bishop, My story was received by his saying 
t ' There are not enough of them. ' * I then told him 
that it did not matter how few the number as long 
as they entertained the idea that it was the wish of 
Satan, they would accomplish their purpose regard- 
less of results to them. Shortly after I learned they 
were killing cattle. I had some cattle on the range 
myself, and in my search for them I found the skull 
of an ox which I had owned. I operated a grist mill 
at the time and the Indians would come there for 
grinding, and I remember that it was about the sixth 
of March that I informed them that I had found the 
skull of my ox and asked them why they had killed 
it, as I had always been a friend to them, as had the 
Mormon people, generally. I talked to them in such 
a way that they agreed to pay me for the animal 
which had been killed by fetching me a horse, and 
they did so next day. I agreed to meet with them at 
Manti about the eighth of April and talk the matter 
over of their killing our cattle. Accordngly the 
council took place. It appeared the difficulty would 
be settled amicably, but a certain young Indian pre- 
sent whose father had died during the winter contin- 
ued to halloo and make demonstrations, saying that 
he would (eat Mormon beef) and kill " Mormons " 
when the snow went off. I told him a time or two 
to stop and permit me to finish my talk. Just then 
some one called out "lookout, he is getting his ar- 
rows !" I rode up to him and turned him off his 
horse, and pulled him to the ground. The bystanders 
interferred and we separated. I had fully exposed 
what they intended to do. The next day as our 



338 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 



Illimtllll! 



people were out hunting cattle a man named Peter 
Ludvigsen was killed. I have always taken the posi- 
tion that that talk with the Indians "showed their 
hand. ' ' I believe they started hostilities sooner than 
they would have done had not the incident above 
mentioned occurred. But the trouble would have 
come just the same. I am confident many lives were 
saved, because it put the people on their guard. The 
chief, Black Hawk told Charles Whitlock of Eph- 
raim, the same thing as had been told me concerning 
the intention of the Indians. These are facts as to 
the starting of the Black Hawk Indian depredations. 
In those early days its was at times imperative that 
harsh measures should be used. Hamilton killed an 
Indian dog, and whipped some Indians too, but that 
didn't start a war; I threw an Indian out of my 
house and kicked him off the place, and no war 
came of it. We had to do these things, or be run 
over by them. It was a question of supremacy 
between the white man and the Indian. 

I have patiently borne the stigma placed upon 
me, for I knew the facts, and to those who still 
persist in looking upon me as guilty of precipitat- 
ing the Black Hawk War I will say this, that I ap- 
peal from their decision to a higher court Our 
Creator, who will ultimately judge all men.

Indians in Grass Valley, Piute County, Utah 

did not want to go to the Uintah Reservation to live. 

At the time the U. S. Government set apart the 

Uintah reservation as a home for the Utah Indians 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 339 

MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII1IIIIIIII1IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM 

some Indians living in Thistle Valley, Sanpete 
County, and a few in Grass Valley, Piute County, 
were very much opposed to going to live permanently 
on the Uintah Reservation. Soldiers, Indian Agents 
and white traders were not esteemed by these In- 
dians and they so stated. 

President Brigham Young instructed President 
Albert K. Thurber and George W. Bean^to visit 
these Indians and take them under their watchcare. 
Some of the Indians in Thistle Valley moved to 
Grass Valley ; some also came up from Escalante and 
others came over from Wayne County to live at 
Greenwich in Grass Valley, Piute County, Utah. 
After the death of A. K. Thurber and George W. 
Bean about A. D. 1900, William H. Seegmiller, then 
president of the Sevier Stake of Zion, in reflect- 
ing over the situation of the Grass Valley Indians, 
concluded that in years to come the Indians there 
might feel that as their friends we had neglected 
them and did not inform them of the advantages 
that they might obtain in lands, money, blankets, 
clothing, farming implements, cattle, horses, educa- 
tion, etc., should they go to the Uintah Indian Reser- 
vation. Elder Francis M. Lyman, an Apostle, who 
had under his care these Indians was consulted about 
the matter, and of the welfare of these Indians, he 
consulted with Jos. L. Rawlins, then a Senator from 
Utah in Congress, 1893 to 1903 who presented the 
matter to the Committee of Indian affairs in Con- 
gress, who informed him that the Indians not on 
the reservation in Utah might still be enrolled with 
the Uintah Indians and receive the same advantages 
as those at Uintah had received, an instructed Presi- 
dent Seegmiller to secure the services of the best 



340 INDIAN DEPKEDATIONS 

Indian interpreter he could get, and with him go 
over to Grass Valley and clearly inform the Indians 
there of the benefits that would come to them, if 
they would go to Uintah and enroll themselves with 
the Indians there. President Seegmiller had George 
Hatch informed the Indians that he and Archibald W 
Buchanan would be over on a certain date and want- 
ed a meeting with them, as he had important mat- 
ters to present to them for consideration. 

The Indians assembled in the stack yard of 
John Hatch close to the Indian village near Green- 
wich. The Indians were sullen and said, they were 
members of the Mormon Church and why did we , 
their old friends, want to drive them away to 
the Reservation? Did the Mormons want to get 
their land from them and make homes for 
themselves! They would rather starve here and 
eat dirt than go to the Reservation and have their 
squaws defiled and their generations cut off by de- 
cease, than to get money, land, blankets, etc., by 
going to the Reservation. They threw away (tarab- 
bied) their Mormon friends, but would not go to 
the Reservation. 

Interpreter Buchanan then told them we did 
not want to remove them to the Reservation; we 
wanted to be their friends as always, and for them 
to choose whether they would go or remain. 

If they wanted to go to the Reservation and 
could see a benefit in it, well and good, but if not, 
to feel that we were their friends and would not 
force them to go. 

President Seegmiller spoke to the Indians in 
a kind and fatherly way and said, they were to 
choose their course whether to go or stay, and in 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 341 



time to come he did not want them to reproach their 
"Mormon" friends for not informing them ^hat 
they could get by going to the Reservation. He de- 
sired that they should assimilate the conduct of their 
"Mormon" friends, quit their begging and farm 
industriously, fence their farms, build houses, raise 
horses, cattle, hogs, sheep, etc., make gardens, go 
to meetings on the Sabbath day, send their child- 
ren to the District School and to the Sabbath school, 
and thus become independent and sustain them- 
selves. 

After this was made clear to them by the visit- 
ors to their understandings, they seemed pleased, 
took us back (cotch tarriby) to be their friends al- 
ways, a great shaking hands was had and we and 
the Indians were all (tic-a-boo) friends and have 
been ever since. 

GRASS VALLEY INDIANS IN 1914. 

Peter Gottfredson, who has been collecting the 
history of the Indians in Utah, writes interestingly 
of a recent visit to the Grass Valley Indians at Koo- 
sharem, Mr. Gottfredson says in part : 

"I visited their Sunday school class. It con- 
sists of about twenty members. The teacher is Louis 
Hatch, who is sustained as missionary to the Indians 
by the authorities of Sevier Stake. He is the son 
of George A. Hatch, who occupied the position of 
Indian Missionary for many years and who was 
greatly beloved by the Indians. The elder Hatch 
died four years ago. At his death the Indians 
grieved very much, many of them crying at his 



342 INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 

funeral. It was at their own request that a son of 
George A. Hatch was appointed to have charge 
of them. 

Wappus, a venerable Indian of Koosharem, 
says that he was twelve years old when Brigham 
Young and his company came to Utah. Wappus is 
now blind. Many Indians lose their eyesight due 
to the fact, it is said, that they are in the smoke 
of their wickiups so much of the time. When a 
boy, Wappus went with his father to see the white 
men. He was formerly of Thistle Valley, but sold 
his farm there and placed his money in a Richfield 
Bank. 

"A much older Indian than Wappus, is "Chick- 
ney shootem" or "Old Tom," as he is otherwise 
known, he is the oldest Indian in the colony and is 
said to be more than one hundred snows. " 

There are about forty Indians in the settlement. 
Some of them own their land, holding patent, and 
paying taxes, others have filed on land, but have not 
yet proved up their claims. Some of the Indians 
own horses, cattle, wagons, buggies and farm ma- 
chinery. Last fall eight sewing machines were 
purchased by the Indians there. A number of the 
younger squaws are quite expert with the machines. 

The Indians of Koosharem do not like to talk 
of the Indian troubles of early days, and they don't 
think that the re-unions of the Indian war veterans 
are a good thing. They say their people have quit 
fighting, are living as the whites do, and that the 
old troubles should be forgotten. Nor do the In- 
dians want to go to the Reservation. A few days 
ago "Indian Pete" asked me why I was writing 
about the Indians. I told him that perhaps I would 



INDIAN DEPREDATIONS 343 

make a book, and he seemed to fear that my pur- 
pose was to complain against the Indians, so that 
they would have to leave their farms and go to the 
Keservation to live. I am hoping to gain their 
confidence, so that I shall be able to get more infor- 
mation about them. I have arranged to get some 
photographs of them.-" 

KANOSH KOOSHAHEM INDIANS BEAR DANCE. 

Peter Gottfredson. well know compiler of In- 
dian war history, gives the following account of a 
unique celebration recently held by the Kanosh and 
Koosharem Indians: 

The Kanosh Indians under Chief Andrew Hong- 
kub, and the Koosharem Indians under Chief Walker 
Ammon, celebrated a ten days "Bear Dance " re- 
union between Richfield and Elsinore, Sevier County 
from March 7th to 17th. The legend on which the 
bear dance is based is an old one. It refers to two 
Indians who went hunting in the mountains. While 
they were out a heavy storm came up and they got 
lost. In roaming around they ran upon a bear's 
den. The bear was away and the two Indians sought 
shelter in the cave. Being hungry, they helped 
themselves to the nuts and other provisions which 
bruin had stored up for the winter. 

"One Indian decided to remain in the den the 
rest of the winter, but the other found his way back 
to the village. The bear returned to her den and 
made friends witn the Indian who was there. 

"In the spring, when the snow was gone and 
the grass was getting green the Indians in the vil- 
lage went out in search of their brother who had 



344 INDIAN DEPEEDATIONS 



been gone so long. They came to the cave, where 
they saw the Indian, the she bear and a cub, danc- 
ing joyously at the return of spring. " 

"As observed now, the bear dance celebration 
is in part is a religious rite to show thankfulness that 
another winter has been survived, that summer is 
again at hand and all is well. It is a custom for 
friendly tribes to come together to renew friend- 
ship and cordiality.?* 

"In the bear dance the squaws form in lines 
opposite the musicians, two by two holding hands. 
With a chant, accompanied by the instrumental 
music, the lines step forward four steps, then the 
same distance backward, ending each advance and 
retreat with a kind of springing movement. One of 
of the squaws from each pair step out and touches 
a male Indian, who becomes her partner in the 
dance. Then she goes back and joins the other 
squaw, repeating the advance and retreat steps as 
before. The partner next steps forward and per- 
forms a chase in front of the women. Then he places 
a hand on the shoulder of either squaw, all the while 
keeping step with the music. The squaws separate 
and let the buck into line with them locking'arms, the 
male with his back towards the music, the forward 
and backward steps are repeated and kept up until 
the music stops. It is considered a breach of man- 
ners for any of the dancers to stop before the music 
ceases. 

"The orchestra consists of four Indians, a tin 
tub, bottom upward, and notched sticks. Each In- 
dian places one end of a notched stick on the tub, 
to provide resonance, and see-saw up and down along 
the notches with another. The dancing is kept up

Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll II IIIIIIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMIIII 

each afternoon and each night until towards mid- 
night. There is not much moving around camp dur- 
ing the forenoon. 

"Seventy-six Indians took part in the Kanosh- 
Koosharem celebration, and hundreds of visitors 
went to the camp and witnessed the dance. 

"After a good deal of persuasion, the chiefs per- 
mitted photographer R. D. Adams to take a number 
of pictures. Most Indans are shy of a camera.
